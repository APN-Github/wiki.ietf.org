# Public Side Meetings at IETF 116


IETF participants occasionally organize side meetings around [IETF meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings) to discuss topics of interest to some portion of the IETF community. While these are side meetings, the IETF does provide this wiki to register the topics, contact persons, dates and times, and other information about the meetings being planned. This page provides details for side meetings around  [IETF 116 Yokohama](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/).


### Notes about public side meetings

* Side meetings posted here are open for any registered IETF participant to attend and are subject to the [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well).

* Working group business needs to occur during scheduled working group sessions in ways that comply with [RFC 2026](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2026.html)  and [RFC 2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html), which is not the case for informal side meetings.

* Side meetings may be used for design teams or other informal discussions related to working groups.

* Side meetings do not record attendance ("blue sheets") as is done during IETF working groups sessions.

* Each room will be equipped with a [Meeting Owl](https://owllabs.com/products/meeting-owl-3) 360-degree camera with microphone and speaker to facilitate remote participation. Side meeting organizers are still responsible for providing their own conferencing bridge to use with the camera.

* Since there are many freely available conferencing services, the [IESG](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/) has decided not to provide conferencing support for side meetings.

* Active consent from participants should be sought by organizers for any side meeting that is recorded.

* Side meeting dates and times should be listed in Yokohama local time, UTC+9 (Please note that Europe and the USA go into Daylight Savings at different times before the meeting, so pay attention to your time zones!). For help converting time zones, please use a tool like [Time Zone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html). 

If you would like to provide an .ics file for a side meeting, please put the link in the appropriate column below.

#  ***!!!NEW!!!*** Two Step Process to Schedule a Side Meeting 



# Step One: Meeting Information
**1. Enter your meeting information (day, time, name, area, contact, description, room links) into the [meeting information table](#meetinginfo) below. Note this is not the room reservation. The actual room reservation is step 2.**

**2. Please choose the day and time that best accommodates your group and complete the room reservation by entering the meeting name in the tables further down. This is the actual room reservation. If the meeting is not in the room table, the room is not reserved!**

## Meeting Information {#meetinginfo}

At a minimum, please make sure to provide a day/time/room as well as meeting name, point of contact and meeting description.

For remote participation: Please arrange your own conferencing service and put the link in the table if you would like to have remote participants.

***Note this is not the room reservation. The actual room reservation happens in the tables in Step 2!***
 
Please sort the meeting by time if possible.
