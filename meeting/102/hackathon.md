# IETF 102 Hackathon
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is holding a Hackathon to encourage developers to discuss, collaborate and develop utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions that show practical implementations of IETF standards.

**When:** Saturday and Sunday, July 14 and 15, 2018
**Where:** Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Montreal, Room: Centre Ville (Ground Floor)
**Sign up for the Hackathon here:** [REGISTER!](https://www.ietf.org/registration/ietf102/hackathonregistration.py)
**View the list of registered Hackathon attendees:** [Attendees](https://www.ietf.org/registration/ietf102/hackathonattendance.py?sortkey=3&login=)

- Champions will have table signs on the center of their table identifying their project and be available to answer questions at the start and throughout the hackathon. Optionally, champions may create and display posters on flip charts with additional information on their project. Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in this wiki in the "Projects Included in Hackathon" section.
	- Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
- Development Environment
	- Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
	- Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs
	- Installing and becoming familiar with VirtualBox, Vagrant, or something similar will help
	- Note to champions: if planning to make use of VMs, please bring on USB drives to make available to others as download times can be painful
	- Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Java), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose
- Network
	- Wireless access to the IETF network will be provided, and from there to the outside world
	- Wired access to the IETF network is available by request only
	- If you have additional requirements, email Charles Eckel: eckelcu@ cisco.com
- Sharing Code
	- Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
	- An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
	- [IETF Hackathon GitHub Org](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon)
		- If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to Charles Eckel: eckelcu@ cisco.com
- Training Materials
	- Network programmability based on IETF standard protocols and models is relevant to many projects. Self paced online training modules are available on Cisco DevNet. Access is free but a DevNet account is required. You can login or create an account quickly with this event specific link https://developer.cisco.com/join/ietf102
	- [Introduction to Device Level Interfaces (Module, 4 labs)](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces)
		- [Introduction to Standard Models](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces)

	- Champions for each technology are encouraged to share any other things they think would be helpful in preparation for the hackathon
- Project Presentations
	- All teams have the opportunity to present what they did on Sunday afternoon at the end of the hackathon
		- https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf102-project-presentations is for IETF hackathon participants to upload their hackathon project presentations
		- You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon GitHub](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
		- To be added as a member, email Charles Eckel: eckelcu@ cisco.com your GitHub ID at your earliest convenience
		- DO NOT WAIT until just before hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos
### Remote participation
- Participating in person is preferred, but we understand not everyone can travel. If you want to participate remotely, please contact the champion(s) of the project to determine how best to coordinate.
- Jabber room: xmpp:hackathon@jabber.ietf.org
- Meetecho: http://ietf102.conf.meetecho.com/
### IPR and Code Contribution Guideline
All hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each participant's organization and/or open source project says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.
