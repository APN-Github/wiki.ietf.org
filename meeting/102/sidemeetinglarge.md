# Side Meeting Room Reservations
In order to facilitate the scheduling of conversational side-meetings, the IESG is providing an attendee sign up room at IETF 102 in Montreal. Meetings held in Square Dorchester are subject to the [IETF Meeting Room Policy](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/meeting-rooms-policy/) and the Secretariat will monitor usage for compliance.

The room holds approximately 40 people, is configured with a U-shaped table and there is a projector available. You are limited to no more than a total of three hours during the IETF 102 meeting week.
