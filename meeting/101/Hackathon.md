### Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
- Champions will have table signs on the center of their table identifying their project and be available to answer questions at the start and throughout the hackathon. Optionally, champions may create and display posters on flip charts with additional information on their project. Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in this wiki in the "Projects Included in Hackathon" section.
	- Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
- Development Environment
	- Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
	- Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs
	- Installing and becoming familiar with VirtualBox or something similar will help
	- Note to champions: if planning to make use of VMs, please bring on USB drives to make available to others as download times can be painful
	- Specific coding languages are called out for some of projects (e.g. Python, Java), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose
- Network
	- Wireless access to the IETF network will be provided, and from there to the outside world
	- Wired access to the IETF network is available by request only
	- If you have additional requirements, email Charles Eckel: eckelcu@ cisco.com
- Code Lab
	- Thanks to Comcast and Arris, we have the ability to create experimental networks. We also have access to a CMTS and cable modems to simulate home networks. Email requests for these to Charles Eckel: eckelcu@ cisco.com and Chris Tuska: Chris.Tuska@ arris.com
- Sharing Code
	- Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
	- An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
- Training Materials
	- Network programmability based on IETF standard protocols and models is relevant to many projects. Self paced online training modules are available on Cisco DevNet. Access is free but a DevNet account is required. You can login or create an account quickly with this event specific link https://developer.cisco.com/join/ietf101
		- [Introduction to Device Level Interfaces (Module, 4 labs)](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces)
		- [Introduction to Standard Models](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces)

	- Champions for each technology are encouraged to share any other things they think would be helpful in preparation for the hackathon
### Remote participation
- Participating in person is preferred, but we understand not everyone can travel. If you want to participate remotely, please contact the champion(s) for that project to determine how best to coordinate.
- Jabber room: xmpp:hackathon@jabber.ietf.org
- [Meetecho](http://www.meetecho.com/ietf101/hackathon): Active and recorded Saturday from 09.30-10.00 and Sunday from 14.00-16.00
### IPR and Code Contribution Guideline
All hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each participant's organization and/or open source project says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.
