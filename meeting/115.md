## Meeting Venue

Hilton London Metropole


## Airport Transportation

### Elizabeth line
The [Elizabeth Line](https://www.heathrow.com/transport-and-directions/by-rail-or-train/elizabeth-line) is London’s newest rail line is now open for passenger service and stops at Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3, 4 and 5.

### Heathrow Express to Paddington Station

[Heathrow Express](https://www.heathrowexpress.com/#/) - there are also ticket kiosks where you can purchase an Heathrow Express ticket before you get on the train, but the web site is cheaper.

To catch the Heathrow Express at Heathrow Airport:

For Heathrow Airport terminals 1, 2 and 3, follow the signs inside the terminal buildings for Heathrow Central train station.

For Heathrow Terminal 4, follow the signs inside the terminal building for the free shuttle bus service to Heathrow Central train station, where you can get on the Heathrow Express train. The shuttle service from Terminal 4 departs every 15 minutes and is a 4 minute journey.

For Heathrow terminal 5, follow the signs inside the building for Heathrow Terminal 5 train station.

To make the return journey to Heathrow Airport from Paddington Station:

At London Paddington, the Heathrow Express usually departs from platforms 6 and 7, but check the electronic boards inside the station for the latest information.

Please NOTE: Departing from London Paddington, the first train is at 5.10am and the last train is at 11.25pm.

Departing from Heathrow Terminal 5, the first train is at 5.07am and the last train is at 11.42pm.

Departing from Heathrow Central, the first train is at 5.12am Monday to Saturday and 5.08am on Sundays. The last train is at 11.48pm.

For Heathrow Terminal 4, the first shuttle to Heathrow Central train station is at 5.23am Monday to Saturday and 5.53am on Sundays.

Main alternative is to take the Underground (= metro). This much cheaper (~£5 vs ~£25 single) and much slower (~50 minutes vs ~15 minutes to Paddington).

For nearly all public transport in London (including bus, metro and most trains), you can either use your contactless credit or debit card, or else use an Oyster card - but unfortunately not on the Heathrow Express.

[Oyster Card](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/what-is-oyster). If you have a contactless credit or debit card with a logo of concentric arcs, in most cases you can use that instead of Oyster and pay the same. 

### From Paddington Station to Hilton London Metropole

It is a short distance (0.4 mile or 8-10 minute walk) to walk up Praed Street (in the same direction as traffic) towards Edgware Road. The Hilton London Metropole is at the corner of Praed and Edgware.
