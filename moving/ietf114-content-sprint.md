# IETF 114 Content Sprint
With the upcoming retirement of the old IETF wiki platform, we held a “content sprint” for folks who want to be among the first to move content to the new IETF wiki platform, [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki).

The wiki content sprint at [IETF 114](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/114)  was open to any IETF participant and took place from 1400-1800 ET US (1800-2200 UTC) on 23 July 2022 in the [Salon 10](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/floor-plan?room=room-salon-10#floor-mezzanine) room of the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown, the IETF 114 meeting venue.

Possible interests: general, specific WG or meeting or other wiki, documentation 

Topics covered include:

## Setting up initial wikis for a few specific groups and meetings

### emodir

### IETF 115 meeting
using https://wiki.ietf.org/meeting/NNN/ as the base and then separate pages for main meeting wiki and side meetings, e.g.:

https://wiki.ietf.org/meeting/115/sidemeeting



### IETF Hackathon at IETF 115

### IESG

## Exploring and documenting options for sitewide features

Features include:
* Sitewide navigation (including footer link)
* Search
* Tags used on pages

## Developing and providing documentation for creating and maintaining content on the new platform

What is needed, who needs that, how should it be delivered. These might include:

* Quick start guide for wiki maintainers
* Templates for different types of wikis
* Guidelines for managing the wiki.ietf.org (e.g. navigation, permissions)
* Updating general site attributes where possible, documenting requirements for those that are not possible to update during the sprint


## Mapping out and confirming strategies for migrating existing content to the new wiki platform


All existing Trac-based wikis will be archived, not all will be migrated.

The goal is to complete migration shortly after IETF 115 (5-11 November 2022)

# Questions and issues
* Is it possible to tag particular sections of a page as "protected" from editing?
	   * It is possible to restrict access through "Page rules" but these must be implemented by administrators.
