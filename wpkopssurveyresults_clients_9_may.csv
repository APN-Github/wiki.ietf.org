Chain building happens concurrently with processing extensions and other requirements.

Currently there are 3 certificate verification libraries compiled into the latest development Firefox and two invocation parameters.

1. NSS 'classic'. This an optimistic (greedy) algorithm to try to find a root . If asked to find errors, it will try to get all errors related to a verification in a verifylog struct. This is
what is used by default for DV certs.

2. NSS libpkix. Uses a depth-first search for finding a certificate root. It uses an exception model to find the errors and as such it can’t handle more than one error returned. It is used by default for EV (and on error fallbacks on classic). However you can make it the default for verification (no classic) on desktop and will only return one error. This is a non-default configuration,

3. mozilla::pkix. Experimental depth first search for finding a certificate root. It does use a ranking mechanism and generally returns the most serious error encountered. This is the default in Nightly and Aurora.

Default algorithm for choosing which library to use in current release Firefox:
if (Cert looks like EV) {
    Do Libpkix verification
    on success return
}
return classic verification

However, we are moving towards using mozilla::pkix everywhere, and currently plan to do so from Firefox 31 onwards (due for release in July 2014).",,,,,20,Does the product enforce key usage constraints?,,"_X_ Yes, via Key Usage
