- Rene: If he has time, he'll post a short draft. (If so, will be shortly before the cut-off)
- if any other drafts are planned, please let the group know. 

Rene: Benoit posted the external review for 10 days instead of two weeks? Sheng: Not clear. 
Rene: On homenet, there was a related discussion, but not cross-posted to anima. Someone should
forward the main points to ANIMA. 
Michael: Should we reach out to homenet and ask for the feedback? 
Sheng: If there is no feedback, we assume there is no problem. 
Michael: Not so sure about that... 
Sheng: Another new WG was proposed, and there was also no feedback. 
Michael: Will ask Benoit how he will interpret no feedback: "No problem", or "need more time"?
