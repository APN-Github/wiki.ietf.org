Firefox uses the NSS root store.

Inclusion in Mozilla products requires CAs to be in conformance with the BRs.  
In order for a CA to get EV-treatment, they must also comply with the EV Guidelines.",,,,,2b,What circumstances result in blacklisting/ removal of “EV status”/removal of a root from the trusted key store?,,"
EV-treatment will be removed if the CA fails to provide an annual EV audit statement. EV-treatment is not given whenever the revocation checking fails.

Blacklisting and root removal is according to Mozilla’s policy:
