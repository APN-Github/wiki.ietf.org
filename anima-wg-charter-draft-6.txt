Autonomic Networking Integrated Model and Approach (ANIMA)

----------------------------------------------------------

Autonomic Networking focuses on self-management of network elements. An autonomic 
function works in a distributed way across various network elements, but allowing
central guidance and reporting, and co-existence with non-autonomic methods of management.
Elements of autonomic functions already exist today, for example IGP routing protocols
such as OSPF, although its initial configuration process is not autonomic.  However, all
such functions have their own discovery, transport, messaging and security mechanisms as
well as non-autonomic management interfaces.

To transform the somewhat abstract Autonomic Networking concept into concrete, realisable
requirements, the first stage, undertaken in the Network Management Research Group (NMRG)
of the IRTF, was to define terminology and design goals, and to derive a high-level gap
analysis. The definitions and design goals, as well as a simple architecture model are
defined in draft-irtf-nmrg-autonomic-network-definitions; the gap analysis for AN is
described in draft-irtf-nmrg-an-gap-analysis. The UCAN BoF at IETF 90 discussed use
cases and some existing solutions. All the above work serves as a baseline for this working
group.

This working group defines solutions for an initial set of components of an autonomic
networking infrastructure, based on the simple architecture and design goals defined in
draft-irtf-nmrg-autonomic-network-definitions. It is recognized that autonomic functions
will co-exist with traditional methods of management and configuration, and the initial
focus will be on self-configuration. Future work may include a more detailed systems
architecture to support the development of autonomic service agents. The Anima working
group will initially focus on enterprise, ISP networks and IoT.

The solutions target to cover the following areas: 
o identity of nodes
o common security model
o discovery model
o negotiation model
o a secure and logically seperated communications channel
o an example for an autonomic management model

The goals of this working group are: 
o Definition of a generic discovery and negotiation protocol for autonomic functions
  Starting point: draft-jiang-config-negotiation-protocol
o Definition of a solution to bootstrap a trust infrastructure 
  Starting point: draft-pritikin-bootstrapping-keyinfrastructures
o Definition of a solution for a separated Autonomic Control Plane
  Starting point: draft-behringer-autonomic-control-plane

In addition, autonomic service agents will need to be defined to solve specific use cases. The
working group will initially consider one or two simple examples as test cases for further work. 

o Definition of solutions for one or two selected use cases
  Starting points: draft-use-case-tbd1&2

It is essential that these components and solutions fit together as an integrated whole.
For this reason, an overview document will be developed in parallel with the individual
specifications.

The initial set of work items is limited to the above list to stay focused and avoid
"boiling the ocean". Additional documents concerning policy intent, other autonomic
infrastructure components, use cases or autonomic service agents are strongly encouraged,
as individual submissions, but are not planned as working group deliverables for now
 No additional work items will be accepted in the working group without re-chartering.
