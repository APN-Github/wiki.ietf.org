# Moving plan

The current plan for IETF wikis anticipates only keeping the content at trac.ietf.org available on the Web for some short amount of time after [IETF 115](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/115) and then turning off the service to avoid out-of-date content and confusing search engine results. 

The Trac instances are expected to be archived and available indefinitely, but will to take some effort to access (i.e. rather than be a running webservice).

> Please feel to [reach out directly](mailto:support@ietf.org) if you are responsible for a wiki currently hosted on trac.ietf.org for which assistance migrating to wiki.ietf.org would be helpful.

# Status
The move status of all IETF wikis is recorded on a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sBp9ikHE6U2JBZzGmc5zdKrom1MP060x9RhJ04j2LM4/edit?usp=sharing) which can be updated by anyone. As you move a wiki, please update the spreadsheet.

The status of wikis moved by IETF Secertariat and LLC Staff will be updated in the spreadsheet.

# Tips

Here are some tips you might find useful when moving from Trac markup to the Markdown used for Wiki.js

+ Use an external text editor as an intermediate step
+ Make sure to update pointers in IETF Datatracker when complete
+ When the transition is complete, add a notice in the *old* wiki with a pointer to the new wiki (see the [old 6lo wiki](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/6lo/wiki) for an example)
