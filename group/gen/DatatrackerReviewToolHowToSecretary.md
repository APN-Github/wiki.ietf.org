# Datatracker Review Tool How-To for Secretaries

This page is for helping a directorate secretary manage review assignments via the Datatracker Review Tool.

[Basics for accessing the Review Tool](/group/gen/DatatrackerReviewToolHowTo) -- This page assumes that you have secretary permissions and that you are logged in.

## Review Tool Setup

If your review directorate is already set up, your directorate's review page can be found at: ​https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/[directorate-name]

To create a directorate, please contact ​support@ietf.org. You will probably also want a mailing list in addition to a review tool.

To help with the setup, the following questions should be answered:

* At which point in the process will reviews occur? Last Call? Telechat? 

The **Secretary settings** tab allows you to set the following:

* Automatic reminders for reviewers
* Length (number and days) of completed review list for reviewers 

**Providing Team Information**

You can provide information about your team by going to the **About** tab and editing the following:

* Team name
* State of the review team
* Additional Information - good place to add links to wiki pages that explain how the team works
* Personnel - add review members here
* Mailing list info - good place to add how people who are interested in joining the team can do so 

The About section of the page is added by the Secretariat. Please contact ​support@ietf.org to provide text.

## Managing Assignments
**Making Assignments**

1. Go to ​https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/[directorate-name]/reviews/
2. Click **Manage Unassigned Reviews**. A list of documents that need a reviewer assigned appears.
3. Select the reviewer's name from the drop-down list.
4. Click **Save**. The review page reappears.
5. Click the **Email open assignments summary** button. Ensure the information is correct.
6. Press **Send**. 

To customize the email message, contact ​support@ietf.org.

**Closing or Reassigning Assignments**

Assignments are automatically closed if the reviewer uses the review tool to submit their review.

Sometimes a reviewer won't be able to complete an assignment or doesn't complete an assignment (as shown in the Deadline column on ​https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/[directorate-name]/reviews/).

To close or reassign:

1. Click the document name in the Request column of the "Open review assignments" table. The review request page appears.
2. In the Assignment section, select one of the following:
*  Complete review - useful if the reviewer did submit a review to the mailing list, but had a problem with submitting via the review tool. The complete reivew page appears. Provide information to complete the review (cut and paste the review from an email, select result state, etc.)
* No response - reviewer did not submit a review by the deadline.
* Withdraw - reviewer is unable to complete the review by the deadline. You can assign to another reviewer with the Assign reviewer button at the bottom of the page. 

## Reviewer Management

When a secretary adds a reviewer, the reviewer has the ability to update their settings (how often they want an assignment, when they are unavailable, if they would like reminders, etc.) This is covered on the [Datatracker Review Tool How-to](/group/gen/DatatrackerReviewToolHowTo) page. Please point a new reviewer to this page so they can customize their settings. The secretary will receive email when the reviewer adjusts their review frequency or unavailability information.

The secretary can also make updates to the reviewer's settings:

1. Go to the **Reviewers** tab.
2. Click the reviewer's name. Their settings page will appear.
3. Make any updates. See the [Datatracker Review Tool How-to](/group/gen/DatatrackerReviewToolHowTo) page for details on the settings.
4. Save the changes. 

To see an overview of the reviewers' assignments, completed reviews, and settings, go to ​https://datatracker.ietf.org/review/[directorate-name]/reviewers/.

**Giving a Reviewer Time Off**

When making a BIG assignment (more than 200 pages, for instance), you can give the reviewer a break by clicking "Skip next time" check box. This will take them out of review rotation for one rotation.

**Note:** Keep an eye on this. This has been a fragile part of the tool in the past (reviewers get stuck, the queue rotation starts acting odd...).

**Removing Reviewers**

When a reviewer leaves the team, go to the **Edit Group** tab and click the x next to their name. This will send email to the reviewer, chair, and secretaries, and remove the reviewer from the tool.
