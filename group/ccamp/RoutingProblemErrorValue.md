# Temporary Registry of Error Values for the RSVP Error Value "Routing Problem"



RFC 3209 defines the Error Code "Routing Problem" and IANA has assigned this the value 24.

IANA is responsible for assigning values for the associated Error Values, and maintains a registry on its web pages.

Since many Internet-Drafts are currently assigning Error Values, this temporary registry may be used to track those values to avoid duplicate assignment and to more easily facilitate early implementation.

This registry does NOT replace the work of IANA. The Error Values listed here can be expected to move under IANA control if/when the associated Internet-Drafts are approved as RFCs.
