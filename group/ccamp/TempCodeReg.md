# Temporary Codepoint Registries 


Now that RFC 7120 has been published, early allocation of code points is much easier. This means that maintaining temporary code point registries should be an extreme exception.

Furthermore, per RFC 5226, the inclusion of code points in I-Ds prior to IANA assignment should not be done except when the I-D defines a whole new registry.

Here are some old pages that included temporary registries when they were used. These pages should probably be deleted.

*    [Temporary Registry of LSP Attribute Flags](/group/ccamp/LspAttributeFlags)
*    [Temporary Registry of Administrative Status Object Flags](/group/ccamp/AdminStatusObjectFlags)
*    [Temporary Registry of Routing Problem Error Values](/group/ccamp/RoutingProblemErrorValue)
*    [OSPFv2 Routing Protocols Extensions for ASON Routing](/group/ccamp/AsonRoutingExp)
