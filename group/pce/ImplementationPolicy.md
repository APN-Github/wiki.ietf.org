# Implementation Policy followed by PCE WG

All WG I-Ds are required to include an 'Implementation Status' Section (as per RFC7942) to document known existing or planned implementations. The chairs can make exceptions on a per-document basis.

It is expected that all WG I-Ds requesting WG LC from May 2019 must follow the above implementation policy. Reach out to the chairs in case an exception needs to be made for your document.
