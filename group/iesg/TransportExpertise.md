# NomCom 2022 Transport Expertise

 Together, the Transport Area Directors are expected to effectively charter, manage and review current and new transport work, including congestion control, loss recovery, Quality of Service (QoS, including Differentiated Services and reservation signaling), performance metrics for Internet paths, and storage protocols for the Internet.

Together, the Transport ADs should have a broad understanding of core end-to-end transport topics and knowledge about the widely used transport protocols, such as TCP and QUIC, as well as how transport technologies interact with network-layer technologies and protocols and with various application-layer protocols, but they are not expected to be experts on all or even most of these topics. Rather, they are expected to work well with Transport Area participants who are experts, and to have enough familiarity with the principles involved to exercise their own judgment about what should be done and why.

Having an overall architectural view of security and privacy, NAT and Firewall, encapsulation and tunneling, and higher layer technologies such as web technologies can be of value.

Because Transport Area working groups often have common interests with IRTF research groups, especially ICCRG, MAPRG, and PANRG, familiarity with these research groups and their subject areas is helpful. Having at least one Transport Area AD with some background in the broader research community is also helpful. There are also open source communities that implements transport area related protocols which there are beneficial to have contacts with.

Together, the Transport ADs are expected to organize their workload, e.g., document review, email discussions as follow-up of document review, IESG emails, WG management, etc, in such a way that the average workload for each AD is about 15 to 20 hours per week.

Transport ADs manage and recruit volunteers in order to maintain the Transport Area Document Review Triage Team (“TSV triage team”) and the Transport Area Review Team (TSV-ART).The TSV triage team provides support for the ADs by assigning document reviews to TSV-ART, and TSV-ART provides reviews on request and during Last Call that can be used by the Transport ADs as input for their ballot positions. The Transport ADs may delegate any tasks that can be delegated, but the ADs themselves still have ultimate responsibility to ensure that transport considerations are appropriately taken into account during IESG Evaluation.
