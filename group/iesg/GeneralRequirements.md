 This text is about the general requirements for being an AD and the IETF Chair (see important attached files below). It's adapted from the job description prepared for the Nom Com in 2006. Specific details about each Area are at [AreasDescription](/group/iesg/AreasDescription). Interaction with the Nom Com is discussed at [IesgNomcom](/group/iesg/IesgNomcom).

Generic Requirements:

IESG members are the managers of the IETF standards process. This means that they must understand the way the IETF works, be good at working with other people, be able to inspire and encourage other people to work together on a volunteer basis, and have sound technical judgment about IETF technology and its relationship to technology developed elsewhere.

ADs select and directly manage the WG chairs, so IESG members should possess sufficient interpersonal and management skills to manage ~15-30 part-time people. Most ADs are also responsible for one or more directorates or review teams. So the ability to identify good leaders and technical experts and recruit them for IETF work is required. Having been a WG chair helps in understanding the WG chair role, and will help in resolving problems and issues that a WG chair may have.

In addition, all IESG members should have strong technical expertise that crosses two or three IETF areas. Ideally, an IESG member would have made significant technical contributions in more than one IETF area, preferably authoring documents and/or chairing WGs in more than one area.

IESG members are expected to make sure that every document coming before the IESG is properly reviewed. Although IESG members may delegate the actual review to individuals or review teams, the IESG members will need to understand and represent the reviewers' objections or comments. So the ability and willingness to read and understand complex information quickly is another important attribute in an IESG member. (Except for drafts they sponsor, this does not mean that every AD must review every draft personally, but they must be satisified that adequate review has taken place.) ADs are expected to track Last Call comments for documents they sponsor, and generally oversee the document shepherding process.

It is helpful for an IESG member to have a good working knowledge of the IETF document process and WG creation and chartering process. This knowledge is most likely to be found in experienced IETF WG chairs, but may also be found in authors of multiple documents.

IESG members must also have strong verbal and written communications skills and a proven track record of leading and contributing to the consensus of diverse groups.

A few comments on the IESG role:

Serving on the IESG requires a substantial time commitment. The basic IESG activities consume between 25 and 40 hours per week (varying by area and by month, with the most time required immediately before IETF meetings). Most IESG members also participate in additional IETF leadership activities, further increasing the time commitment for those individuals. Even if they do not occupy formal liaison positions, ADs may also need to interact with external bodies such as other standards organizations, which may require travel. It is also imperative that IESG members attend all IETF meetings (typically arriving one or two days early) and up to two additional IESG retreats per year.

Because of the large time and travel commitments, employer support for a full two year stint is essential for an IESG member. Because of personal impact including awkwardly timed conference calls, an IESG member's family must also be supportive.

IETF Chair:

The IETF Chair has four major roles: overseeing the work of the IETF as a whole, representing the IETF to the outside world, overseeing the work of the IESG in particular, and serving as the General area director.

Serving as IETF Chair is currently a full-time job. So, a candidate for this position needs to be willing to put aside his or her own technical work and other major professional roles for at least a two-year period.

Chairing the IETF requires excellent communications skills, strong leadership skills and the ability and willingness to keep the community informed of all issues that are important to the IETF as a whole, to establish community consensus on those issues and to speak and act in accordance with that consensus. Among other things, this involves working with the IAB Chair to plan plenary sessions and effectively running meetings with over 1000 attendees.

The IETF Chair serves as a member of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) and as a Trustee of the IETF Trust. Although day to day management of administrative matters is entrusted to the IETF Administrative Director (IAD), the IETF Chair can expect to spend some hours per week on IAOC or Trust business, particularly in the context of ensuring the IETF is properly supported by its service providers, and that the IAD has adequate support in this area.

The IETF Chair is asked to speak at numerous conferences and to represent the IETF to government officials, representatives of other standards bodies and the press. While the IETF Chair has control over which of these invitations he or she accepts, any candidate for this position should be willing and able to represent the IETF effectively in these fora, in consultation with the IAB Chair as appropriate.

In the IESG chair role, the IETF chair is responsible for coordinating the activities of the other Area Directors and providing top-level management for the IETF standards process. The IETF chair must be capable of intervening when difficulties arise between ADs or between an AD and a WG chair. The IETF Chair also oversees the handling of appeals sent to the IESG, the mechanisms for IESG internal process change, and the production of any statements issued by the IESG.
