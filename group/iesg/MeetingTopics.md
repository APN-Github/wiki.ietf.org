# Meeting Topics

## Suggested topics for the next face-to-face meeting 

(This page will be cleared out and replaced after each meeting.)

### IETF 115, (London, UK) 


#### 1. Document Queues (IESG only, added to Sunday's meeting) (Lars/RTG Area ADs)

#### 2. DNS alternate naming

It is currently for IAB business meeting with Warren and Wes

#### 3. Updating "Surprised Authors" statement (Warren,  10 min)

More like 5 minutes, assuming everyone says "Poifect! Let's just do that!". Not during IEPG (Sun 10-noon) nor TDD, please!


> Unsure where to add it to the IAB-IESG joint session
