 RFC2026 section 4.2.3 contains this text:

Documents proposed for Experimental and Informational RFCs by IETF Working Groups go through IESG review. The review is initiated using the process described in section 6.1.1.

The review process in 6.1.1 and the subsequent sections of 6.1 *REQUIRE* an IETF Last-Call as part of the review.

The IESG statement at http://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/ad-sponsoring-docs.html extends this to cover AD sponsored individual submissions to the IETF stream with this text:

AD Sponsored documents to Experimental or Informational require some form of review in the IETF and IESG approval. While RFC 2026 does not require the latter type of documents to go through an IETF Last Call, this statement suggests that it is always performed.

Summary: For working group informational products, Last Call is required. For individual submissions to the IETF stream, the IESG suggests they always be performed.
