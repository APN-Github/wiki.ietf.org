# Issue Tracking
The Secretariat handles many small items of work, and thus needs systematic issue tracking. Emails that don't go into the issue tracker '''will''' get lost.

Therefore, when raising any kind of operational issue with the Secretariat, it's essential to
use the email addresses that feed the tracker. The complete set of addresses is listed [here.](http://www.ietf.org/secretariat.html) For ADs, the most important one is [support@ietf.org](mailto:support@ietf.org).

When you write to one of these addresses, you should soon receive a robotic reply including
a ticket number in the subject field. For example, ''[Inquiry # 84280] Auto Reply: Fix to the home page.''
Make sure to conserve this subject field in  all replies, so that the tracker can track the thread.

Tip: when sending a ticket to the Secretariat that you want the whole IESG to see, but you do not want the whole IESG involved in the robotic follow-up, do it like this:

>  Subject: Approved: draft-foo-bar-73
>  To: iesg@ietf.org
>  Bcc: iesg-secretary@ietf.org
> 

Then only you will be involved in the follow-up.

## Suggested Subject Lines for Tickets 

Another tip: It '''really''' helps the Secretariat if you use a standard subject field.

1. Request to Publish: [insert file name of I-D]*

  Please use this subject line when requesting that an I-D be published as an RFC. (Note: These requests usually come from a WG chair or an individual author.)

2. Last Call: [insert file name of I-D]*

  Please use this subject line when requesting a Last Call, or when clarifying a Last Call request made via the I-D Tracker. If multiple documents are included in the Last Call, then please use the filename of one of them, and explain in the body of the message that you are requesting a single Last Call for multiple documents.

3. Agenda: [insert file name of I-D]*

  Please use this subject line when requesting that a document be placed on the agenda for the next telechat.

4. RFC Editor Note: [insert file name of I-D]*

  Please use this subject line when forwarding an RFC Editor Note to be included in the approval announcement for a document.

5.  IESG Note: [insert file name of I-D]*

  Please use this subject line when forwarding an IESG Note to be included in the approval announcement for a document.

6. Approved: [insert file name of I-D]

  Please use this subject line when notifying the Secretariat that a document has been approved for publication between telechats. If multiple documents are included in the approval, then please use the filename that you used when you issued the Last Call.

7.  Query: [insert topic]

  Please use this subject line when requesting information about something that the Secretariat knows something about (like "what happened to my request for X?"). Please use an abbreviated "topic" in the subject line (to avoid truncating the text) and provide details in the body of the message.

8. Verify: [insert topic]

  Please use this subject line to confirm that the Secretariat has taken an action. Please use an abbreviated "topic" in the subject line (to avoid truncating the text) and provide details in the body of the message. If the Secretariat has neglected to take an action that it should have taken, then this message will serve as a reminder to either take the action or explain to the AD why the action has not been taken.

9. Management Issue: [insert topic]

  Please use this subject line when requesting that a management issue be added to the IESG Teleconference Agenda.

10. Agenda Bash: [insert topic]

  Please use this subject line when requesting an IESG Teleconference agenda bash (i.e., to request a late management issue, to change the order of documents, to remove an item from the agenda after the final agenda and package have been sent, etc.).

''* The subject lines that are followed by an asterisk should only be used when it is necessary to request this action using the iesg-secretary ticket system. Each of these tasks should be completed using the Datatracker when possible.''
