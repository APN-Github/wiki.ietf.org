# 2013 Applications Desired Expertise

 *Applications*

The Applications Area has historically focused on three clusters of protocols. The first cluster contains application protocols that have been ubiquitous for some time, but these protocols continue to develop (e.g., email, HTTP, FTP). The second cluster contains protocols that are used for Internet infrastructure (e.g., IDNA and EPP). The third cluster contains "building block" protocols that are designed to be used in a variety of more specific applications (e.g., LDAP, MIME types, URI schemes, URNs, language tags). Current WGs include topics such as email updates and anti-abuse mechanisms, internationalization, web foundations and security, JSON data format, simple resource manipulation mechanisms for devices in constrained networks, an updated WHOIS protocol, and a protocol to access radio spectrum databases.

The Applications Area often discusses whether something is properly the realm of the IETF or "belongs" to other SDOs. As a result, an Applications AD needs to be willing and able to relate to a wide range of non-IETF organizations, such as the W3C and Unicode Consortium. The Applications Area often re-uses technology developed elsewhere. An Applications AD is also trusted to make critical decisions about the scope of the IETF's applications protocol work.

Because of the breadth of the Applications Area, an Application AD needs to deal with a large set of application protocols, including many with which he or she may not have direct experience. An Applications AD needs to be good at evaluating new approaches to new problems and assessing the expertise of the people who bring them to the IETF.

The set of people in the Applications Area changes with the protocols under development at the time. Therefore it is important that an Applications AD be able to clearly explain how the IETF works and can help new WGs work well within the IETF standards process. The ability to reach out to new technology communities is also important so that the Applications Area stays relevant to the ongoing evolution of Internet applications.

The Applications Area most often intersects with, and sometimes swaps WGs or work items with, the Security Area, the RAI Area, and the Transport Area. In addition, WGs in other areas often re-use technologies that were developed or formalized in the Applications Area (e.g., URIs, MIME, JSON, and XML). Therefore cross-area expertise in any of these areas would be particularly useful.
