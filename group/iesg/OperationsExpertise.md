# NomCom 2022 Operations Desired Expertise

*Operations and Management*

Unlike most IETF areas, the Operations & Management area is logically divided into two separate functions: Network Management and Operations. This year, the Operations AD role is open, so specific expertise required for the open position includes a strong understanding of Internet operations, as well as the ability to step into Network Management issues when necessary.

The primary technical areas covered by the Operations side of Ops & Management include: operational issues facing the Internet such as DNS operations, IPv6 operations, global routing (including SIDR) operations, benchmarking, IOT operations, operational security, as well as Network Management.

The Operations AD role includes soliciting operator feedback and input regarding IETF work. This is a challenging task that requires strong contacts in the operations community and a great deal of persistence to maintain constructive engagement.

Another important role of the Operations AD is to identify potential or actual operational issues regarding IETF protocols and documents in all areas, and to work with the other areas to resolve those issues. This requires a strong understanding of how new and updated protocols may affect operations, and the ability to gather information from the operations community and translate that information into suggestions for protocol architecture and design within the IETF. It also requires a strong cross-area understanding of IETF protocol architecture and technologies.

The Operations portion of the Ops Area interacts most often with the Routing, Internet and Security areas. So, cross-area expertise in any of those areas would be particularly useful.

Even more than most AD roles, the Ops AD position requires a very wide range of cross-area knowledge; understanding if an RFC will impact operations requires being a generalist and the ability to know if it will impact operations and actually be deployable in real networks.
