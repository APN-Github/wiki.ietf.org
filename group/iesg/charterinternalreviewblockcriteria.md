# Block Criteria for a WG Charter in Internal Review
- Significant technical concern with the viability of the work
- Significant procedural concern with the ability to complete the
  work effectively due to low energy levels, contentiousness,
  **overly large scope of the work**, etc.
- Lack of technical clarity on what the work and deliverables will
  actually consist of
- Lack of scope for what is clearly in-bounds versus things that
  should be explicitly forbidden
- Overlap or interference with other work inside or outside the
  IETF, which would lead to clear harm or significant operational
  issues
- Quality of writing and editing poor enough to prevent effective
  external review of the proposed work
- It's a really really bad idea (e.g. key escrow)
- Inappropriate phasing of the work that may lead to inadequate
  focus or end-runs of consensus process.
- **Out of scope for the IETF**.
