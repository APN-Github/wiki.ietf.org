# Mailing Lists

All ADs will be added to the *iesg@ietf.org* list of course, and also to the private lists mentioned at the IESG Internal wiki.

All ADs need to keep an eye on the main *ietf@ietf.org* list for matters concerning their Area and the IESG as a whole. It's also assumed that ADs track the *ietf-announce@ietf.org* list. 

Each area has its own lists (Directorates etc.) and of course ADs need to keep in touch with WG mail, either by being subscribed or reading archives.
