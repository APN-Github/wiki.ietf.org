# Handling changes when the I-D is already in RFC Editor queue

## Updates after the I-D has entered the RFC Editor queue

For significant changes post-approval, the RFC Editor recommends that a new version of the I-D be loaded to the datatracker. Doing so ensures that the reader is looking at the most current draft, and there is a record of when and how the changes were incorporated. It also allows us to easily point to a diff file when seeking AD approval.

RFC Editor recognizes that “significant" is subjective – they suggest it includes new text, removal of text, and changes to technical content. In general, RFC Editor thinks it's helpful to upload a new version.  It ensures RFC Editor get notified that a change is needed.

Insignificant changes (e.g., updates to email addresses) can be sent to <rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org> at any time.  

Please contact <rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org> if you have any questions about your specific document.

## Expedited processing

If you think your document needs to be expedited, please consult with the IESG to ensure there are no objections.  This is usually done via email or by adding a management item to an IESG call.  If approved, the Secretariat will notify the RFC Editor.  Please be sure to indicate the date by which the document should be published and any other relevant information.  

Also, please consider whether your document is part of a cluster.  Does the rest of the cluster need to be expedited as well?

Notes:
- Expedited processing is most often requested when there are time-sensitive issues (e.g., coordinating publication with another organization).  
- This process should also be used when only an RFC number is needed by a specific date.
