# Archive of Past IESG Projects 

 * [2nd Retreat]() - agenda bash for possible 2nd retreat in 2019

 * [Quick Working Groups]() - Quickly chartering short-lived, tightly scoped working groups with short schedules (Barry and Pete)

 * [Mailing List Archiving]() - Proposed IESG Statement regarding mailing list archiving (Pete)

 * [Draft 2119 Boilerplate Suggestions]() - Proposed boilerplate for use with RFC2119 that allows the use of RFC2119 keywords in normal text if they are not in all-uppercase.


 * [Special Use Top Level Domain Process]() - How to deal with requests for special use TLDs

 * [Perpass Discuss Criteria]() - how the IESG approaches draft-farrell-perpass-attack

 * [IESG Reorg Messages]() - Proposed messages to the community on the IESG Re-organization

 * [Modern Formats Discussion]() - in-progress capturing current IESG thoughts on updating RFC canonical format

 * [Liaison Purposes]() - discussing role of IAB and IESG liaisons

 * [Meeting Experiments]() - documenting experiments tried for WG meeting


 * [Charter Internal Review Block Criteria]() - Proposed criteria for balloting 'Block' during IESG internal review of a WG charter proposed for external review.

 * [Number Of Authors]() - IESG Statement on the Number of Authors in an IETF Document (Alvaro and Terry)

## Some abandoned or obsolete stuff that's nonetheless useful to save 

 * [Draft Shepherd Writeup WG Alternate]() - A new proposal for a radical change to the shepherd writeup, as discussed at IETF 84.  This is a version that strips out all the yes/no sorts of things and instead asks for a paragraph or two of information in each of five categories.  **(This is now part of the normal shepherd writeup documentation)**

 * [Draft Note Well Summary]() - A draft version of a very short Note Well summary.  **(This is now dead.)**

 * [Draft Boilerplate Change]() - A draft of a change to the boilerplate for cases where we are publishing something (such as documentation of a vendor-specific mechanism) where the community has consensus to publish, but consensus on the content doesn't make sense.  **(The IAB has chosen not to approve this, but the text is still useful as an IESG note in such documents.)**
