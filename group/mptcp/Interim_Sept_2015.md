Multipath TCP WG Interim meeting Audio, Thursday 10th September, 3pm GMT/UTC

Agenda to include topics we didn't get to, or didn't properly discuss, at Prague:-

- MPTCP proxy - Xinpeng Wei
- Using MPTCP for channel combining for NASA project - William Ivancic
- Deployment use cases - A.Palanivelan

There are also several drafts from people who weren't in Prague, at least some of which we should think about how / if to progress (for instance by including in the protocol bis document). So these should also be considered. Requests for discussion time:-

- [draft-paasch-mptcp-syncookies](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-paasch-mptcp-syncookies) - Christoph Paasch
- [draft-paasch-mptcp-loadbalancer](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-paasch-mptcp-loadbalancer) - MPTCP's use behind layer-4 loadbalancers in server farms - Christoph Paasch

Open issues:

- we have consensus to add an experimental MPTCP option to the protocol bis [see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bonaventure-mptcp-exp-option/]. But we have the question whether it should be 8 or 16 bits.
- check consensus to change ADD_ADDR2 format (replacing IPVer field by Flags field)

We also plan to do the final completion of the Operationl Experiences draft and create the Implementations WG draft in the next weeks.
