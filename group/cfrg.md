# IRTF Crypto Forum Research Group

For more information please visit the [CFRG web page](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/cfrg/about/). 
The documents of the Research Group can be found [in the datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/cfrg/documents/).
A significant part of current work on the drafts is done using [CFRG GitHub repositories](https://github.com/cfrg).

The mailing list can be accessed via [Mail Archive](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/cfrg/).

[Crypto Review Panel](/group/cfrg/reviewpanel) is managed by CFRG Chairs and is used to review crypto algorithms and their use in IETF protocols. It is used to review documents submitted to CFRG, IETF Security Area and Independent Submission Editor.

Some information on current cryptographic primitives currently in use in the IETF can be found here: 

* [ Symmetric Encryption Algorithms](/group/cfrg/symenc)
* [ Hash Algorithms](/group/cfrg/hash)
* [ Keyed Message Authentication Code Algorithms ](/group/cfrg/keyedmessage)
* [ Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms ](/group/cfrg/asymetric)
* [ Digitial Signatures ](/group/cfrg/digitalsig)
* [Elliptic Curves](/group/cfrg/ellipticcurve)
* [Password authenticated key establishment (PAKE) protocols](/group/cfrg/pakeprotocols)
