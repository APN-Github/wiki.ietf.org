# Transport Area Review Team Guidelines

The [TSV Area Review Team](/group/tsv/TSVART) reviews selected documents within the transport area and selected documents from other areas. This page describes the current guidelines for TSV Area Review Team.

## Review Requests
The TSV ADs appoint a "triage team" that assigns TSVART reviews for documents that are either

- Requested specifically by the TSV ADs, at any time
- Requested by other IETF working group chairs, identifying documents for early review
- Identified during IETF Last Call by the triage team as having potential TSV issues

Prior to the use of the triage team, the ADs performed this task and assigned directorate reviews to individual directorate members.

The review tracking tool uses an automated round-robin approach to assigning reviews such that everyone completes roughly the same number of reviews, but may deviate from that when special review expertise is desired.

## Review Timeline
When a review is assigned, the reviewer will receive an email message describing the review request. The reviewer MUST use the link in this email to accept or reject the review request. This should be done as rapidly as possible, so that if the review needs to be reassigned, there is time to do this. The review request can be accepted or rejected quickly, and is a completely separate action from actually performing the review (that is more time consuming).

Most reviews are for documents in IETF Last Call. These reviews should be completed within the Last Call timeframe, if possible. They should at least be done prior to the TSV ADs balloting for the document prior to its IESG telechat date (absolutely no later than 24 hours before the telechat).

If the timeframe where the review would be useful passes, the triage team can mark it as OBE in the tracker.

## Review Format
You can submit reviews either via the datatracker or manually by email. If using email, you still need to login to the datatracker and indicate that the review has been submitted. The tracker allows you to link to the mailing list archives where the review appears. Reviewers are highly encouraged to use the datatracker to submit the reviews, because then this book-keeping is done automatically, and all relevant email addresses are automatically populated and copied.

Using the tracker to enter a review involves answering some multiple choice questions (about the version of the document reviewed, its state of readiness, etc), and then entering the free form text of the review body.

Generally, TSVART reviews should especially focus on transport-related issues. However, reviewers are of course free to raise any issue they deem important, transport-related or not.

The overall review result is selected in the datatracker from among:

- Not Ready
- On the Right Track
- Almost Ready
- Ready with Issues
- Ready with Nits
- Ready

If submitting a manual email review, the same categories should be applied and indicated at the top of the review.

Also, please take a look at the Gen-ART review guidelines at http://www.alvestrand.no/ietf/gen/art/review-guidelines.html.

## Review Boilerplate
The below boiler plate is for IETF Last Call or IESG Reviews.
```
This document has been reviewed as part of the transport area review
team's ongoing effort to review key IETF documents. These comments were
written primarily for the transport area directors, but are copied to the
document's authors and WG to allow them to address any issues raised and
also to the IETF discussion list for information.
```
When done at the time of IETF Last Call, the authors should consider this
review as part of the last-call comments they receive. Please always CC
tsv-art@ietf.org if you reply to or forward this review.
## Review Submission
The datatracker tool will send the completed review to all relevant parties, mailing lists, etc. This is the easiest way to complete a review.

If not using the datatracker to submit the review, you need to copy the review to all of:

- For all reviews: tsv-art@…
- For all reviews: draft-alias.all@… (with alias replaced by the actual draft name)
- For all working group documents: the appropriate working group alias
- For IETF Last Call reviews: ietf@…
- For drafts on the IESG telechat or with major issues: iesg@…

In addition for early review of documents that includes transport port requests per [RFC 6335](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6335) it is requested that you CC the IANA ports team (iana-port-experts@…), especially if you have comments related to the port assignment.

## Review Common Issues
[TSVART common issues](/group/tsv/TSVART-common-issues) describes some issues that have come up during TSVART reviews, and includes guidelines to provide authors about how to resolve them. This is documented so TSVART reviewers are fairly consistent in their advice.

## Review Status
https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tsvart/reviews/ holds the current review assignments to TSVART members with the respective due dates.

Training Material
Updated [Training Slides](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/tsv/raw-attachment/wiki/TSV-Directorate-Reviews/20180314-02-TSV-ART-Review-Tutorial.pdf) from IETF 101 in London.
