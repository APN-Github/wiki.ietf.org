# Working Group Rechartering - Nov. 2009
 The WG is now considering new charter items to fill in for the ones that we have finished. The WG has the opportunity to propose new items for the charter to the IESG, or we can choose to not do more work after our current chartered items are done.

The following is a list of proposed new work items for the WG, and the proposed starting point(s) for each one. The goal is to start a working group discussion to select the most relevant work items, and to reach a precise definition for each one.

Note that for some of the drafts we don't have an official Internet draft yet. These will be submitted before the WG meeting at IETF-76.
