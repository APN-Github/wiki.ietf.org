# IPsec-Related Academic Papers
 The list below is by no means exhaustive. It contains papers that are reasonably recent (post-2000) and that we believe may be useful to implementers. It does not contain papers that are primarily of historical value, e.g. much of the protocol work that led to IKEv2.

Readers are encouraged to add relevant papers, subject to the above criteria. The list is ordered by the primary author's name.
