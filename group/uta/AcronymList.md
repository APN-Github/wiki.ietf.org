# Acronyms
When adding acronyms, please

- keep them in alphabetical order
- mark specially if this is a vendor-specific acronym
- add links (if found) to references, including references to RFCs

Feel free to add an acronym that you don't know - then mark it with question marks, like

- TKRQZZZ : ?????? (Needs explanation)

Also do remember to add your name and email to the author section below. All contributions are done under the IETF Note Well.
