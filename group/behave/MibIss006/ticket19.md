# Juergen's comments on new MIB module vs update existing MIB module

## Description 
As far as I recall, it was initially not clear whether there is consensus that the NAT-MIB is fatally flawed. (And the text that is now in section 3.1 did not exist at that time in the current level of detail as far as I recall.)

I suggest a consensus call is made by the chairs on this fundamental question. If there is consensus that the NAT-MIB is fatally flawed (and note that opinions of implementors in particular matter here), then declaring the MIB module in RFC 4008 historic (e.g. marking RFC 4008 historic) and creating a new MIB module may indeed be the right thing to do.
