# NAT MIB v2 Issue 026: Verify what address types natPoolRangeType can support 
**Source:** DBH review, comment 28.

**Details:**

28) natPoolRangeType - can this support any of the address types allowed by this textual convention? Or should the text constrain the acceptable values? I'm not sure which ways to limit this are acceptable. Let me know if all the address types cannot be supported, and I'll check with other mib doctors to determine the best way to constrain it.

**Discussion:**

**Resolution:**
