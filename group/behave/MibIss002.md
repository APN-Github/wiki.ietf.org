# NAT MIB v2 Issue 002: Security Considerations text non-conformant to boilerplate
Source: Ticket: [#15](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/behave/MibIss001/ticket15) comment 1.

## Details:

1) Section 5 of the current draft has:

...

Also the document has 2 paragraphs of text "There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain ... versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment." which do not appear in the current MIB boilerplate at the link above. Should those 2 paragraphs be removed?

## Discussion:

This issue appears as a matter of form only, so that Ticket: [#15](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/behave/MibIss001/ticket15) can be closed out.

## Resolution:

Fixed in later versions.
