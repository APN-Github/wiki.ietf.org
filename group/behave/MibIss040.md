# NAT MIB v2 Issue 040: Standardize high and low usage mode for pools 
**Source:** DBH review, comment 26.

**Details:**

26) natPool watermarks

There is mention of low usage mode and high usage mode. Is there a REFERENCE you can make, maybe to NAT requirements or something, that explains this a bit more? Is there a reason why BEHAVE is not trying to standardize low/high usage behaviors? (isn't standardizing behaviors what behave is all about?)

Are the "may" terms here RFC2119-compliant? Usually RFC2119 "may" terms are capitalized.

**Discussion:**

**Resolution:**
