# NAT MIB v2 Issue 032: Clarify meaning of natSubscriberIntPrefixType 
**Source:** DBH review, comment 36.
**Details:**

36) natSubscriberIntPrefixType is a "Subscriber's internal prefix type." While the corresponding address is a "Prefix assigned to a subscriber's CPE." I tend to think of a CPE as being the border between a subscriber's network and an ISP's network. If the subscriber entry represents a host served by a managed enterprise NAT, is this still the prefix type for the CPE? Please clarify if the type is the internal prefix type for the subscriber's CPE, or simply the subscriber's internal prefix type.
**Discussion:**

**Resolution:**
