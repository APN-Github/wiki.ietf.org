# NAT MIB v2 Issue 005: No statement of whether IANA action is required 
Source: Tracker: [#15](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/behave/MibIss001/ticket15) comment 3.

## Details:

3) Section 6 does not say whether any additional actions for IANA are needed. Suggest adding "No IANA actions are required by this document."

## Discussion:

This issue appears as a matter of form only, so that Ticket: [#15](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/behave/MibIss001/ticket15) can be closed out.

## Resolution:

Fixed in later versions.
