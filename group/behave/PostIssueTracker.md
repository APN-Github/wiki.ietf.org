# Post-WG Issue Tracker
Created 2014/08/31.

This is the entry to the issue tracker for three documents left over after closure of the Behave Working Group and currently undergoing the process of publication by AD sponsorship. Spencer Dawkins is the sponsoring Area Director. A fourth document has been added given the decision to split the NAT MIB document into separate drafts deprecating the first version of the MIB module and specifying the second one.

Click on Project to link into a per-document issue index, which in turn links into detailed presentation of each issue.

Major issues are those that change MIB content or affect operations, and are resolved through list discussion. Minor issues are resolved by the design team, with results reported to the Behave list.

Tom Taylor mailto:tom.taylor.stds@â€¦ is serving as common contact for this work, acting on behalf of the document authors.
