## Open DT meetings
Prior to the IETF 115 the  OPen DT has been meeting on a weekly basis. We had plans to go back to the normal working group processes, however we have found some issues that makes it preferable to continue the weekly meeting for the time being. After the IETF 115 the MPLS Network Actions (MNA) work will be discussed in Open DT meetings "on demand". The MPLS, PALS and DETNET working group chairs has issuedd the following statement:

### Weekly meetings
- [Open-DT-Meeting-2022-11-17 *Open DT Meeting 2022-11-27*](/group/mpls/2022-11-17)
       
-    We will go back to normal working group processes after this IETF.
- 
-    Anyone can ask the co-chairs for Open DT meetings if they want to discuss in a group that have been involved in the MNA specifications.
