# Dynamic Host Configuration (DHC)
Sorry, but there is nothing much here at present. For more on this Working Group, please visit [https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dhc/about/].

What follows is a brief status for the Dynamic Host Configuration (DHC) Working Group as of March 2021.

The DHC WG did not meet at IETF-110 as it currently only has two work products:

1. To complete the DHCPv6 Yang model (see ​[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-yang/]).
2. To advance the DHCPv6 base protocol (see ​[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/) to full standard].
It is possible new work may arrive.

For latest details on the DHC WG documents, please see [https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dhc/documents/].
