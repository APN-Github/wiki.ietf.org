## MPLS

Met on Tuesday morning (9.30 - 12). Packed agenda and productive meeting.
New work is brought in, coordination with TEAS, SPRING and SFC.

Nic could not attend, thanks to Joel Halpern that helped running
the meeting.

One new RFC since London. One document approved by the IESG, and 
in the RFC editors queue.

Several new individual and wg drafts.

We hosted a PALS draft discussion.

Deborah did an "invited talk" on DO's and DON'T's on wg documents.
Would be worth doing in a RTG Area Open meeting.

## NVO3

Meeting: Wednesday, 1:30pm

WG Highlights: 
- Focus on security requirements for the standards track dataplane encapsulation (GENEVE).
- Also ongoing drafts focussing on OAM in overlay networks, particularly alt-making in GENEVE and the identification and encapsulation of OAM in overlays.
- For the control plane, there is an ongoing poll for adoption for a draft that describes the applicability of EVPN for NVO3.

WG Status Summary: 
- New RFC: RFC 8394: Split Network Virtualization Edge (Split-NVE) Control-Plane Requirements
- Past WG last call: draft-ietf-nvo3-vmm-01. Some comments from Ops area review. May also need review by TCPM working group.
- On-going WG Adoption Poll: draft-mglt-nvo3-geneve-security-requirements-03, draft-rabadan-nvo3-evpn-applicability-01

## PALS

## PCE

## PIM

Meeting Tuesday, July 17th, 1550 - 1750

WG Highlights:
* Meeting in own time slot (not shared with MBONED), just too many drafts and we went overtime. Will no longer share a time slot but will meet back to back.
* igmp/mld/snooping/msdp yang drafts progressing.
* Framework for multicast applied to SR-MPLS presented and we will issue adoption call since SPRING is not chartered for multicast.
* Lots of new proposed work inc SR multicast, pim null register, pim graceful insertion, backup dr, graceful dr shutdown, p2mp bfd and pim reserved bits.

## RIFT

Meeting Thursday, July 19th, 1:30pm - 3:30pm 

WG Highlights:

* We had a hackathon at Montreal. Two implementations established LIE adjacency w/o difficulty. Will likely have a virtual one again in September or October.
* We had two two-hour virtual interim meetings on 5/2/2018 and 5/3/2018. Good participation and energy.

WG Status Summary:
* The WG is mostly focused on the base protocol spec and making good progress. Currently -02 revision and will go through a couple of revisions in the near future.
* YANG model draft not adopted as WG doc yet. Will need to create Threat Analysis doc and Applicability Statement doc and progress them all.

* SR-TE Policy draft was accepted by the WG since IETF 101, the document has been broken into multiple parts to ensure clarity.
* Work to clarify service chaining  - and the relationship between SR-based chaining and SFC/NSH-based chaining clarified. Jim Guichard and FranÃ§ois Clad  presented drafts on this topic.
* Work to ensure the operability of SPRING networks continues to be a focus - multiple drafts on OAM, and performance measurement for both the SR-MPLS and SRv6 dataplanes have been brought to the WG.
