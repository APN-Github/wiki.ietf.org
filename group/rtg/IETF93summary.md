# IETF 93 Routing Area Working Group High-Level Summary 

Summaries and Status through IETF 93, July 19 - 24, 2015 in Prague



## [BESS](http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/bess/)
* WG met Monday afternoon
* Stable audience (+100)
* Good meeting with meaningful presentations and constructive discussions on the mic - people applauded at the end of the session
* Other side of the coin: much more time requested (than we had booked) while very little traffic on the list since Dallas. Need to find ways for discussions to also happen on the list.
* IESG buffer nearly empty (1 doc remaining), but 4 to 5 documents will soon knock on the door.
* 2 RFC published, 2 documents Last Called, 2 documents adopted
* 18 WG documents, some ready for WG LC, and few individual I-Ds ready for adoption
&nbsp;
* Do not hesitate asking us for the "how not to get a slot" slide 


## [BFD](http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/bfd/)
* Not meeting at IETF 93
* S(eamless)-BFD drafts have completed WGLC and need document shepherd writeup.  Being heavily collaborative documents involving a large portion of active WG population, Jeff as chair needs to do writeup.  Jeff is behind.
* RFC 5884-bis had completed WGLC and was in a similar waiting on shepherd writeup.  Several comments have recently arrived that need to be evaluated.
* BFD Yang design team has made excellent progress.  Will adopt document after IETF 93.  (Should have adopted earlier.)
* Work with no new progress:
  * BFD multipoint.
  * BFD stability.
* New Work, not currently in charter, mentioned in and out of BFD:
  * Using BFD with VRRP.  (Multiple parties, including some discussion in rtgwg.)
  * BFD for VxLAN.
  * Optimizing BFD authentication. (Previously presented.)
* Potentially dead work:
  * BFD generic authentication and SHA-2 extensions.
  * BFD MPLS MIB.
