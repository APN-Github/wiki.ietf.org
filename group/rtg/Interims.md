# Interim Meetings 
The Secretariat maintain a set of web pages to describe interims [here](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/interim-meetings.html). They show:

- [An archive of email announcements of previous and pending meetings](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/interim.html)
- [An archive of the proceedings of past interim meetings showing agenda, minutes, and meeting slides](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/interim/proceedings.html).
- A link to the [Interim Meetings Manager](https://datatracker.ietf.org/secr/proceedings/interim/) that allows WG chairs or delegates to post the meeting materials.
- A template [Blue Sheet](https://www.ietf.org/documents/interim-meeting-blue-sheet-f2f.pdf) for use at face-to-face interim meetings.
## IESG Statement
The [IESG Statement](https://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/interim-meetings.html) on "Guidance on Interim Meetings, Conference Calls and Jabber Sessions" is dated September 2008. It sets out the rules for such meetings. In summary...

- Interim meetings are subject to the same rules for advance notification, reporting, open participation, and process, which apply to other working group meetings [RFC2418]
- Decisions at meetings (normal, interim. conference call, or jabber session) are not final and must be reviewed on the mailing list.
- **Face-to-face** interims require
	- AD approval
	- Announcement by the Secretariat at least four weeks in advance
	- Publication of the agenda "in a timely manner" which is usually interpreted to mean at least two weeks in advance
	- Collection of a list of attendees (blue sheets) that is returned to the Secretariat
	- Publication of minutes and proceedings in a timely manner after the meeting.
- **Virtual** interims require
	- WG chair approval
	- Announcement by the Secretariat at least two weeks in advance
	- Publication of the agenda "in a timely manner" which is usually interpreted to mean at least one week in advance
	- Collection where possible of a list of participants that is returned to the Secretariat
	- Publication of minutes and proceedings in a timely manner after the meeting.
## Announcing a Meeting
To get an interim meeting announced:

- Check with your AD (in the case that AD approval will be required)
- Send the announcement mail that you want published to iesg-secretary@â€¦ (sample email below)
	- Copy the AD on this email so they can issue approval if required
- Forward the announcement to your WG mailing list (although hopefully you have already been discussing the meeting and there are no surprises)
### Sample Announcement Email
Dear Secretariat (AD cc'ed),

Please send the following email to announce an interim meeting of the Foobar working group.

The Foobar WG will hold an interim / a virtual interim meeting on April 1st from 11am to 1pm EST.

The meeting will be held at the offices of Snaffitt Corp. in Loa Alamos / The meeting will be conducted on WebEx.

The chairs will post details with an agenda closer to the meeting.

Additional information will be announced on the Foobar WG mailing list: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/Foobar/current/maillist.html

## Requesting a WebEx Session for Virtual Interim Meetings
The IETF currently has resources to host WebEx sessions for virtual. The process for getting such a session set up is remarkably simple - just email the Secretariat requesting a session, and sit back and enjoy it. if you have never hosted a WebEx meeting before, make this clear in your request and the Secretariat will give you all the help you need.

## Timeliness
Avoid stress and panic through timeliness (TM).

If you run it down to the wire you risk your announcement not going out on time. The IESG is pretty damn strict about this and will cancel/disallow meetings that don't have enough notice. Similarly if agendas don't come out in time.

Furthermore, if you need resources from the secretariat (such as WebEx) please try to ask them sooner rather than later.

You can use jabber and etherpad as usual. Work out in advance what you main back-channel communication medium will be: there is also the WebEx chat window, and in WebEx people can "raise their hands" to indicate they want to speak.

Lastly, please try to get minutes and slides posted on time. Slides should ideally be up before the meeting so that people can follow along. Minutes really need to be up sooner rather than later - this is particularly important for interims because only a small subset of the WG may have been able to attend.
