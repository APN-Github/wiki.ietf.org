Subject: Routing directorate QA review of draft-ietf-foo-bar-baz

Hi `<reviewer>`

Please would you be the routing directorate QA reviewer for draft-ietf-foo-bar-baz?
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-foo-bar-baz/

Note that this is a “QA review.”  The document does not yet have consensus to be forwarded to the IESG.  The goal of this review is to provide a new perspective on the work in progress and to improve its quality.  Hence, your comments will be provided primarily for the benefit of the `<name of WG>` chairs and the document authors.

Please could you provide your comments by `<deadline date>?`  You should send your comments to the draft authors and WG chairs, and copy the relevant WG mailing list and the rtg-dir list.

The following web page contains a briefing on the QA process, and guidance for the QA reviewer.
https://wiki.ietf.org/group/rtg/RtgDirDocQa

Please let me know whether you can do it, or not.

Many thanks
