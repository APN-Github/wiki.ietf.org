## PALS

Meeting Day/Time: Monday, March 19, 15:50-17:20

WG Highlights:

* The primary focus of the WG continues to be draft-ietf-pals-ethernet-cw, which mandates the use of the Control Word for Ethernet pseudowires (PWs) if both endpoint routers support the Control Word. This is to prevent reordering problems that result from some core routers mistakenly applying ECMP to Ethernet PWs if they look below the MPLS header and see a first nibble of 0x4 or 0x6 in the Ethernet MAC address, and they mistake these packets for IPv4 or IPv6. This problem has been observed in the field. Use of the control word prevents ECMP from being applied. Unfortunately, we've discovered that some vendors are doing DPI past the control word, and mostly getting it wrong, and we have addressed that in the draft as well. 

* We drafted and reviewed a liaison to our SDO partners (BBF, ITU-T SG15 WP3, MEF, IEEE 802.1 & RAC) to inform them about the draft. It was updated during the meeting, and has since been transmitted.

* We are coordinating with the IDR, PIM, PCE, BESS, RTGWG, MPLS WGs and the SEC area to improve LDP security by moving from TCP MD5 to TCP-AO, following BGP's example.

WG Status Summary:

* Two new RFCs since IETF 100.
   * WG has published 18 RFCs (including one STD) since November 2015.

* draft-ietf-pals-ethernet-cw is our last active WG draft. Following our meeting this week, it has been updated and has entered WG last call. Once we finish this draft, we can contemplate the WG's next step.

## PCE

   -  PCE used as a central controller
   -  PCEP used to distribute link state and TE information to a controller

-  We had a liaison from the BIER working group to talk about the application of PCEP for BIER-TE

-  Besides this, we are busy with many applications of stateful PCE:
   -  Associated bidirectional LSPs
   -  E2E protection
   -  LSP Scheduling
   -  Steering IP traffic
   -  Hierarchical stateful PCEs
   -  GMPLS
   -  Etc. Etc.
