# Routing Area Working Group Chair Training 

 In June 2014, Alia and Adrian started a series of WG Chair training sessions. In addition to the WG Chair training sessions, we also have WG Chair Chats periodically (1-3 between IETFs) for open discussion on topics of interest.

At each IETF since IETF 90, there is also a face-to-face optional meeting for Routing Area Working Group chairs. At this lunch, we usually discuss something of interest and also go over the topics and schedule for the training and chats.

Below are the slides and recordings from those which have happened. The quality of the recording may vary from recording what actually happened - with free discussion afterwards not recorded - to a more concise and edited version of the video.

Please feel free to comment on the usefulness of the materials for a meeting, including your name.
