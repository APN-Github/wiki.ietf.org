 All
 
Loa,
Please send me the slides for yesterday's DT presentation critiquing draft-jags.  I consider the yesterday's meeting to be a travesty and a flagrant abuse of process by you, Matthew, and Stewart, and I would like to respond to the slides point-by-point - they were full of misinformation, baseless assertions, and process changes that are inconsistent with established IETF procedures.  The fact that the slides were not already available speaks volumes.
Yours Irrespectively,
John
Juniper Business Use Only

- make slides available on the wiki, (Tarek) 
- short response ???

Proposed mail:

At the MPLS Open DT 2022-12-01 the "complexity" of the MNA solution(s) were discussed, based on a slide deck. We have received a request to make the slide deck available. This slide deck has been posted (link).

This will be back on the agenda on 2022-12-15. We'd like tp hear any concerns on this, either on mail or at the meeting.




- slot on the Thursday
