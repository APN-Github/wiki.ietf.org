# Chair coordination meeting 2022-11-29
## Background
For todays meeting I'd like to a follow up on a discussion I had with Stewart and Matthew yesterday.

I called that discussion because I wanted to follow up on a suggestion at the joint meeting at IETF 115 to "relax requirements".

- While we said that the requirements might need more work, we also 
  said that:

- "The MNA as it is today pushes to much new functionality into the data
   plane. We should return to the MPLS model where control is done
   through the control or management plane."
   
We'd like to solicit feedback on that statement.
