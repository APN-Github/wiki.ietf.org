# MPLS Open DT meeting 2022-12-29 (Cancelled)

## Agenda
We polled a bit on the potential attendance for a meeting 2022-12-29, it showed that we'll be a bit less than a normal meeting. We have decided to use this open slot to review the new version of draft-jags-mpls-mna-hdr-04, that was posted recently.

We have no further agedna.
