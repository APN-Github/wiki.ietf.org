## Agenda

1. **Action Items**
Tarek

2. **Reporting**

   2.1 **Call for Agenda slots**
   The Calls for Agenda slots bortn for the MPLS and the joint MPLS/PALS/DETNET meeting  has been issued. The chairs will use the chair co-ordination meeting 2023-03-21 to finalize the aganda. Consider it a good idea to have slot request in by the.
   
   2.2 **RTG Area WG chairs meeting**
   The RTG Area WG chairs had a meeting 2023-03-07
   
       a. Responsible AD-s
          Andrew will be the responsible AD for MPLS and PALS
          John will be the responsible AD for DETNET
          
   2.3 Discussion on IETF IPR policy in general and the MPLS WG decision 
             
       There was an agrrement on the following points
       
       - each individual participant may privately evaluate IPR disclosures based their own thoughts about the IPR disclosure validity, applicability and terms for each document. Public discussion on validity, apllicability and terms is not allowed in the IETF.

- IPR against documents is evaluated for each document.

- the technical merits for each document is evaluated on their own.

- similar or identical IPRs against two different documents does
  not need to be evaluated in the same way.

- the consesnsus on the call was that(in the long  run) is a self-correcting 
  process, i.e. any company that consistently discloses unpopular IPRs will 
  very shortly be causing more problems   for itself than for other companies.

- as I see it, only a few people from Huawei did speak up, and all that did agreed to this.

- the ADs confirmed that the wg chairs has been handling the WGAP

    The closing of the wgap for draft-jags was planned to be done
    2023-01-14. It has been held open because of a pending IPR disclosure.

    We will allow the working group a few days after the IPR disclosure to
    react to it.

    The closing of the wgap for draft-song was planned to be done
    2023-02-24. This wgap will remain open to allow comments on the new IPR
    disclosure.

    It is clear from the poll on draft-song that there were significant
    objections to adopting it due to concern about the IPR.

    Hence, the shepherd is preparing to call consensus on not adopting this
    draft at this time after the upcoming MPLS Open DT team meeting on
    Thursday.

    There has also been a technical discussion on whether PSD is required
    for MNA or not. The working group chairs suggest that, for the time
    being, the working group holds the progress of PSD, and concentrates on
    cleaning up draft-jags to only address ISD.

    To this end, the consensus of the working group is to adopt draft-jags
    and allow the working group to address the concerns raised during the
    poll after adoption.

    The working group chairs suggest that the draft is cleaned up to only
    address ISD data.

    We anticipate that further discussions of the PSD solution will be
    documented in a new draft.

    The shepherds will allow the polls to remain until EOB of Monday
    March 6th.
