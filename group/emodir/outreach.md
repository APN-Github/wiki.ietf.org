# IETF Outreach

## Types of Outreach

EODIR (earlier called EMODIR) seeks to coordinate outreach activities for the IETF undertaken by individuals and organizations. This wiki page will consolidate materials to help future outreach activities. 

There are outreach activities can be defined based on the following factors:
- target audience 
- anticipated level of IETF participation 
	- knowledge sharing - explaining IETF and how it works, latest updates from IETF meetings including updates from WG/RG 
  - supporter - active support in the IETF mission 
  - coordination - active coordination (including liaison) with the IETF
  - full participation - active and sustained participation in the IETF process (joining a mailing list, posting reviews, authors etc) 
- responsible organization

Some examples of outreach activities are listed in the table below
