## Projects
### Carbon offset
This project aims to measure and potentially offset IETF carbon emissions. For further detail, see the [blog post "Towards a net zero IETF (6 May 2022)"](https://www.ietf.org/blog/towards-a-net-zero-ietf/)

IETF community members are encouraged to discuss this project on the [admin-discuss@ietf.org email list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/admin-discuss).

#### Workshops
**Carbon offset strategy**
This set of workshops will provide information about approaches to carbon offsetting and gather community input to help determine a strategy for potentially offsetting the carbon footprint of the IETFâ€™s activities.

**Carbon emissions measurement**
This set of workshops provided information about the global standards-based approach being developed to calculate, as accurately as possible, IETF carbon emissions (initially focused on emissions from IETF meetings). They particularly sought to gather input from the IETF community about how additional data might be gathered from IETF meeting participants that would allow more accurate carbon footprint calculations.
