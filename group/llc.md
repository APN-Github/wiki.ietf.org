## Projects
### Carbon offset
This project aims to measure and potentially offset IETF carbon emissions. For further detail, see the [blog post "Towards a net zero IETF (6 May 2022)"](https://www.ietf.org/blog/towards-a-net-zero-ietf/)

IETF community members are encouraged to discuss this project on the [admin-discuss@ietf.org email list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/admin-discuss).

#### Workshops
**Carbon emissions measurement**
This set of workshops provided information about the global standards-based approach being developed to calculate, as accurately as possible, IETF carbon emissions (initially focused on emissions from IETF meetings).
