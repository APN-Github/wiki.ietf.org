# Advice for WG Chairs 

## General 

Please take time to browse the following URL:

 http://www.ietf.org/wg/chairs-page.html

It contains many valuable resources.


## Meetings 

1) Meeting time is a scarce resource. Before granting agenda time to a participant, be sure that you can answer the following questions:

   - What is the topic of this draft?
   - How does it fit into the charter?
   - Has the mailing list expressed any interest in the draft?
   - Has this draft been presented in any other WGs?
   - Does the author intend to present this draft in any other WGs?

It is acceptable (and often desirable) to present a draft that has been accepted by one WG in another. However, WG shopping is discouraged.

2) At the beginning of each meeting, display the NOTE WELL slide. It can be downloaded from the following URLs: 

   -  http://www.ietf.org/about/note-well.html
   -  http://www.ietf.org/wg/documents/note-well.ppt (ppt format)


## Submitting Drafts for Publication
