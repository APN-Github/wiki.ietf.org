Last three documents made WG update in the meeting.

  -  Other presented new works are relevant too, but may request the change of current charter text: Guidelines for Autonomic Service Agents, Transferring Bulk Data over the GRASP, Autonomic Slice Networking, Yang model for ANI.
  -  There were 51 attendees on site, and 8 remote attendees. 

## BMWG

 -   Interim Meeting Report (March 1) - discussed NG-firewall benchmarking methodology draft in preparation for this meeting.
 -   There are many other proposals for new work: Network service layer abstract model, back2back frame testing, network virtualization platforms.
  -  All active drafts are correlated with proposed milestones for the revised charter.
  -  The Liaison from ETSI Network Function Virtualization Testing WG was discussed again, and comments will be collected for 1 month on-list (in-progress).
 -   There were 17 attendees locally, most of whom had attended previously, and 8 remote attendees (US attendance was curtailed by the 4am EDT start time).

-    Looked at how to approach the work 
    -    top-down/bottom-up
    -    full architecture or partitioned
    -    simple initial deployments or integrated end-to-end, multi-domain, multi-tenant 
 -   ADs to work out what they saw 

## DNSOP

DNSOP had two sessions - a 2.5 hour session on Tuesday and a 1 hour session for new work Thursday. There were updates to several drafts which were in a stuck stage around WGLC but are now moving again. However, the highlight was the presentation on "The DNS Camel" which attempted to explain why adding more and more features to DNS can have negative consequences, and the community should do more to evaluate new work against this backdrop. There was much discussion. The Thursday session was a scrum of new work, and some reports of hackathon results.
