# IETF 106 - Singapore.

This provides a very short summary of discussions and decisions in each WG.

## ANIMA

ANIMA has completed the recharter process. It is now under the new charter text, which is more flexible.

Update on WG drafts: Autonomic Control Plane, modifications according to IESG review, 2 DISCUSS; GRASP API, ready for WGLC; BRISK, modifications according to IESG review, 1 DISCUSS; Constrained Voucher Artifacts for Bootstrapping Protocols.

New works presented: Information Distribution in Autonomic Networking, rough consensus for adaption; Guidelines for ASA & & Anima ecosystem, Transferring Bulk Data over GRASP, Introduce of ETSI ZSM on closed loops, Layer 2 Autonomic Control Planes, BRSKI Cloud Registrar, BRSKI-AE Updates, ACME Integrations with BRSKI, and Delegated Voucher.

First session, 35 people attended locally, and 5 active remote participants; second session, 27 people attended locally, and 3 active remote participants. 

## BMWG 
WG Consensus on the ENPN WG draft was re-iterated at this meeting. Benchmarking for Next Gen Firewalls Draft has benefited from some lab tests: Some Metrics will be dropped as not-so-useful in the most recent version (submitted just before the meeting, and the discussion of changes needs to move to BMWG-list more completely now (not just the weekly conference calls held by NetSecOpen?). The Back2Back Frame Benchmark Update was updated based on 3 sets of comments, and a few more comments arrived on-list just after the meeting.

Proposed Work: Containerized Infrastructure and Test Device YANG Model Drafts both benefited from work at the Hackathon-106, and there are list comments on both drafts. There are now Open Source tools available for Methodology for VNF Benchmarking Automation draft, and review is promised. Comments on-list for Benchmarking Methodology for EVPN Multihoming Restor. & Mass Withdrawal have been resolved.

22 people attended locally, and two active remote participants.

## DIME

## DNSOP

DNSOP had two sessions at IETF106. The first session worked through WGLC issues with draft-ietf-dnsop-extended-error which the chairs feel was successful. There was also a deep discussion on draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc and the status of the the RR Type and what may need to be worked on. One decision is the names of the new RR Type is not something anyone has strong opinions about, and the authors put a poll together. In the second session, there was updates on existing documents, which are moving forward. The presentation on draft-arends-private-use-tld brought up all the 6761 discussions and there was and is much bike shedding with no real idea moving forward. The document draft-brotman-rdbd one of the chairs feels is relevant to DNSO

## GROW

## MBONED

## MOPS

First meeting as a WG. Discussion of draft-jholland-mops-taxonomy (edge network operational considerations for streaming media), and formal adoption as a WG work item. Jake Holland would welcome a co-author to help move it forward.

Updates from elsewhere -- Streaming Video Alliance's use of CDNI protocol work; Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) recent meeting highlights -- clear dependencies on reliable and granular time reporting in operations.

Issues for streaming operations -- overview of QUIC implications for networks streaming video. There are extensions proposed in the QUIC WG, and operators interested in media delivery should go there to weigh in.

## NETCONF

NETCONF met for 2 hours with a very full agenda. We reviewed the WG drafts: the "client/server" drafts, including the recently-adopted http-client-server draft, notification-messages, notification-capabilities, https-notif.

## NETMOD

## OPSAWG

OPSAWG had a full agenda as usual.

There was considerable discussion around L3NM and some questions from the authors. Follow up needs to happen on the list, which will inform the next revision.

The YANG TACACS+ module draft needed some help from YANG doctors, which happened shortly after the meeting. That draft will produce a new rev and likely close soon.

The iFIT presentation generated both positive feedback as well as items that need additional clarification/work. While there was interest from the WG in the topic of how to best use various OAM options, more discussion and revision is needed to progress this work.

Likewise, the uCPE work drew some confusion from the room as to how it works with RFC8530 as well as with ETSI/NFV. Those conversations need to move to the list to make sure the authors and commenters are on the same page.

Andrew Gray's presentation on data plane telemetry had considerable interest both with the draft and with the topic. As such, Andrew scheduled a side meeting for that here in Singapore.

Finally, Benoit Claise presented Service Assurance for Intent Based Networking in Ops Area. The topic drew interest with some suggestions on splitting out some of the work as well as clarifying the scope of service assurance.

## OPSEC

OPSEC WG decided not to meet at IETF106 due to lack of agenda items.

## RADEXT

## SIDROPS

## V6OPS

IPv6 Operations discussed the operation of IPv6 networks. We intended to have an invited talk from Renu, but that didn't happen - the university changed the timing of the speaker's thesis defense and he was no longer available. We discussed six drafts, much fun was had at the mike, and discussions move along.
