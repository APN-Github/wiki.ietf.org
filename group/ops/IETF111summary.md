# IETF 111 - San Francisco (virtual)

This provides a very short summary of discussions and decisions in each WG.

## ANIMA

## BMWG

BMWG met with 27 participants connected and 2 using Jabber clients. Bill Cerveny took the Minutes. The controversial 2nd WGLC of the Next-Gen Security Device benchmarking draft was the main event. The authors led the WG through their proposals for comment resolution, and most were accepted. About three comments require a text proposal from the last reviewer, then version 10 can be submitted for Doc Shepherd review.

A new RFC 9004 on Back-to-back Frame Benchmark was published, a WG Adoption Call will be offered for the YANG Data Model for Network Interconnect Tester Management, the Multiple loss ratio search draft made some progress, and a new proposal for Benchmarking Methodology for Stateful NATxy Gateways using RFC 4814 Pseudorandom Port Numbers was reviewed (the latter drafts request further review at this stage).
