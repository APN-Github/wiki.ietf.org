# IETF 102, Montreal.

## ANIMA

## BMWG

## DNSOP

 -   draft-ietf-dnsop-algorithm-update - is almost ready for WGLC
 -   draft-huque-dnsop-multi-provider-dnssec - CfA ends today
 -   draft-dupont-dnsop-rfc2845bis - is almost ready for WGLC
 -   draft-wessels-dns-zone-digest - interested in adoption
 -   draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis - interest in adoption.
 -   DNS Cookies and their Operational Impacts - lots of discussion on addressing operational issues around cookies. Also some pushback from WG on killing Cookies all together and using TCP. WG needs to hash this out.
 -   Addressing the Zone Apex Synthetic Records (CNAME/ALIAS/ANAME) - Discussion from Operators/Users/Implementers?. Big issue on DNSSEC and what should be done. More Discussion 

## GROW

## L2SM

  -  L2SM did not meet at ietf-102
  -  The WG's only document/milestone is in the RFC Editor Queue
  -  There was some corridor talk of a possible bis to add and function 

## MBONED

Fuller agenda than usual with wide ranging topics. No great controversies, but lots of discussion:
-draft-ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2-24- updated to unstick holdups from security review at IESG, but WG needs to review these changes
-draft-ietf-mboned-dc-deploy-02- progressing
-draft-xie-mboned-bier-entropy-staged-dc-clos-00- probably better fit for BIER
-draft-jholland-mboned-ambi-00- interesting new work
-Standards evolution for IGMP and MLD- standards docs cleanup, seems worthwhile
-draft-acg-mboned-deprecate-interdomain-asm-00- looks ready for adoption
-AMT GW Implementation in VLC- interesting implementation update

## NETCONF

## NETMOD

## OPSAWG

 -   OPSAWG ; OPS AREA met Tuesday and OPSAWG went first
 -   MUD and NAT YANG are progressing through the IESG
 -   TACACS+ is nearing readiness for WGLC ; we need vendors to indicate adherence to this spec
 -   There were a number of drafts presented: draft-song-ntf, draft-gu-network-mornitoring-protol, draft-li-opsawg-address-pool-management-arch, draft-sun-opsawg-sdwan-service-model
 -   Nothing new was adopted; more comments are needed on the list
 -   OPS AREA shared a presentation on the history of network faults by Ross Callon and John Scudder (generally considered very enlightening)
 -   Ignas shared his perspective on the need for an experiment to enable a coordination of model development that provides more rapid model production (citing Openconfig) 

## OPSEC

## SIDROPS

## V6OPS

The working group met twice. Documents discussed Thursday include draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6rtr-reqs, draft-ietf-v6ops-transition-ipv4aas, draft-ietf-v6ops-nat64-deployment, draft-templin-v6ops-pdhost, and draft-pref64folks-6man-ra-pref64. The pref64 draft is intended for 6man, but was discussed in v6ops for operator viewpoints. There was no shortage of viewpoints. Friday was used as essentially "Any Other Business"; draft-patterson-intarea-ipoe-health and draft-ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains were discussed with a view to getting operator comments on their concepts.

As an outcome, v6ops asked 6man to fast track (do a good job, but do it quickly) in the pref64 draft. The operators expressed a strong preference for an RA option over a quirky and unreliable DNS exchange.
