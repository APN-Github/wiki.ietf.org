# Virtual Interim Meeting -- May 2009
Date: May 21, 2009
Time: 16:00 EDT (20:00 GMT)
Duration: 1 hour
The topic of this meeting is updates to [RFC 3825](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3825). The goal of the meeting is to discuss and seek consensus on which specific updates to 3825 are of interest to the group. The specific items we would like to cover are:

- Correcting the EPSG number for WGS84
- Adding a DHCPv6 option
- Deprecating floors
- Signaling the use of uncertainty in place of resolution
- Other potential updates (time permitting)

Inclusion of an item on this agenda does not mean that there is any pre-existing consensus about the item one way or another (e.g., the discussion on adding a DHCPv6 option could result in the group deciding not to add a DHCPv6 option).
