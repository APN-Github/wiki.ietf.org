# How Meeting Time Allocation is Prioritized
In order to make the working group more effective, time at the face-to-face meetings is allocated as follows:

- Work items will receive meeting time in this order:
	- work items close to being finished that have been discussed thoroughly on the mailing list and for which there are remaining issues that cannot be resolved over mail.
	- work items under development that have been discussed at least some on the mailing list and for which at least some issues cannot be resolved over mail.
	- work items under development where proponents are having difficulty explaining concepts in mail, and for which they believe presentation would help.
	- new work items not yet discussed on the mailing list
- "Discussed on the mailing list" means discussion that takes place earlier than 2 weeks before the meeting, so we can put the agenda together and post it. Clearly mailing list discussion can continue to and right through the meeting, but list discussion in the last 2 weeks before a meeting will not count in giving priority.
- "Work items" includes items that other WGs or ADs want us to comment on, since those can and should be discussed on the mailing list first if possible. In general when a chair says "we need your opinion asap", we should say "send it to the mailing list". However, there can be things that come up at the last minute, so urgent insertions by ADs or other WG chairs are allowed.
