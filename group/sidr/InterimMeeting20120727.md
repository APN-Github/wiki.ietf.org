Call-in toll number (US/Canada): +1-408-600-3600
Access code:643 106 581
Jabber: sidr@…
NOTE: If WebEx? is unavailable for a majority of remote participants during part of the actual meeting, as we did in Paris, we'll halt the local/in-room portion of the meeting until we can sort out WebEx? issues. Jabber will be the primary mode used to recognise such a failure. NOTE2: If there are folk NOT in the US who can not dial the webex-in-webex-voice we can link together a conference bridge with the webex-voice and leverage the synergies of dual conference systems + international-dial-in.
