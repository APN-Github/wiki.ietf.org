# HTTP/2.0 Requirements

This page collects requirements for discussion in the context of HTTP/2.0. Our goal is to agree upon a set of requirements for HTTP/2.0, along with associated exit criteria.

## Charter Requirements

Our charter imposes the following requirements that must be met:

* [Latency](/group/httpbis/http2latency)
* [Network Efficiency](/group/httpbis/http2net)
* [Deployability](/group/httpbis/http2deploy)
* [Security](/group/httpbis/http2security)
* [Intermediaries](/group/httpbis/http2intermediaries)

Note that the charter contains additional criteria for a successful effort, in particular the ability to pass through a HTTP/1.1 message with reasonable fidelity.

## Proposed Additional Requirements

None yet. Please make proposals on-list first; we'll collect those state on those discussions here over time.
