See [the draft agenda](http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/interim/2013/01/30/httpbis/agenda/agenda-interim-2013-httpbis-1).

Some people have discussed staying over the weekend afterwards for a social activity, and at least one dinner will be arranged; details TBD.

## Local Considerations
SIM Cards

Free wifi is not common in Japan, and international roaming can be expensive. With that in mind, here are a few options for renting local SIMs (some data only):

 * [eConnect](http://www.econnectjapan.com/) (data-only)
* [bMobile](http://www.bmobile.ne.jp/english/) (data-only)
* [Softbank Rental](http://www.softbank-rental.jp/e/rental.php) (data and voice)
