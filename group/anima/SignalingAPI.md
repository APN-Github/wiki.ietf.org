An ASA (autonomic service agent) needs an interface by which it calls the signaling protocol. Attached to this page is an obsolete draft of a conceptual or abstract API for this purpose (MS Word and PDF formats). For a current and implemented API see the Python prototype at https://github.com/becarpenter/graspy. Start by looking at the PDF files, especially graspy.pdf.

The latest API specification is at https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-anima-grasp-api.
