## 6TiSCH 
6TiSCH met for around 90 minutes at AM1 on Friday. A status was made that indicates that all work items are complete or reaching completion.
Some possible new work was proposed but no decision was taken in towards rechartering. The most probable outcome is that the WG will not meet again.
The WG will continue its activity on the mailing list to follow the current WG docs to completion, and the ML will stay open for maintenance.

The WG meeting covered 4 drafts:

* draft-ietf-6tisch-architecture is complete but held in MISSREF.
* draft-ietf-6tisch-minimal-security going through IESG review. Some issues left.
* draft-ietf-6tisch-msf: authors presented implementation results. Chairs will submit for publication once a final review is done by Yatch.
* draft-ietf-6tisch-enrollment-enhanced-beacon was submitted for publication.

* draft-tiloca-6tisch-robust-scheduling was also discussed in the end. IEEE was contacted but the proposal failed to raise interest so far. We will follow up on the ML.



## LPWAN 

During IETF 106, the LPWAN WG had a WG meeting and a hackathon session.

The WG meeting covered 6 drafts:

* draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc was presented by Dominique Barthel. The doc passed IESG reviews, about 10% updated, now ready. There are 5 knonw implementations, numerous publications, and SCHC is now being taught in engineering schools. We need the RFC urgently for standardizing use for DLMS at LORa Alliancen and the group requested an expedited processing though RFC editors.
* draft-ietf-lpwan-schc-over-sigfox was presented by Juan-Carlos Zuniga. There is an implementation at university of Chile. Possible optimization using a lower layer sequence counter.
* draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-schc-over-lorawan was presented by Olivier Gimenez, first time at an IETF. 2 intermediate versions and huge progress and great simplifications since last IETF.
* draft-toutain-lpwan-schc-yang-data-model was presented by Laurent Toutain. draft to be resubmitted, no progress since last IETF.
* draft-ietf-lpwan-coap-static-context-hc was presented by Laurent Toutain. This document is ready, submitted for publication, waiting for IESG reviews.
* draft-barthel-lpwan-oam-schc was presented by Dominique Barthel. The draft needs a revision, no progress.


Then we had a rechartering discussion and online editing; the sentence on the COAP draft was generalized to maintaining SCHC for any upper layer protocol and needed fixes. The resulting proposed charter was sent to the list for consensus building.
