# IPv4 - IPv6 Co-Existence Interim 

An interim meeting will be organized on October 1-2, 2008, in Montreal, Canada to continue discussions about IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence, NAT-PT replacement, and new tunneling or translation solutions to address needs in this space. This is a meeting that affects work happening in a number of WGs (SOFTWIRE, V6OPS, BEHAVE, INTAREA).

## Reading List 

Additional background for this topic can be found in [interim meeting announcement e-mail](http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/int-area/current/msg01607.html), [IETF-72 proceedings]([https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/72/materials.html) of the above WGs and the following documents:

## Registration 

Please proceed to the [registration page](/groups/int/RegistrationForv4v6interim). Participation in the meeting is free of charge. (Barring the possibility of overflowing the reserved facility -- which we do not think will happen.)

We do ask you to register latest by **Saturday, September 20th**.

## Hotel Recommendations 

We have negotiated a rate of $134 for a really nice deluxe room at Hotel Ruby Foo's. This includes internet access in the rooms and free parking. Use the following link to make a booking

The hotel is less than a 10 minute walk from the Ericsson premises.

## Invitation letter for visa 


If you would like an invitation letter for obtaining a visa, please send an email to suresh.krishnan AT ericsson.com with the following details.

  * Full Name
  * Passport Number
  * Issuing Country
  * Date of Expiry

## Getting There 

The Ericsson office in Montreal is located close to the Metro station "de la Savanne" and is easily reachable by Metro from various parts of Montreal. It is located on the Orange line of the Metro ([http://www.stm.info/English/metro/a-mapmet.htm map]).

## Remote Participation 

Several people have asked for remote participation facilities. We are planning to arrange a voice stream coming out of the meeting, slide display in real time (via WebEx courtesy of Cisco Systems), jabber scribing, and possibility for questions from the jabber. The voice stream should be accessible either by computer or a phone.

To join the jabber, please use the room "v4v6coexistence" in the IETF jabber.ietf.org server.  You can view the [http://jabber.ietf.org/logs/v4v6coexistence Jabber logs].

To join the online Webex meeting (live slides, bidirectional voice and webcam streaming)

1. Go to [https://ciscosales.webex.com/ciscosales/j.php?ED=108125277&UID=0&PW=6b5fa075cd070156 Day 1] and  [https://ciscosales.webex.com/ciscosales/j.php?ED=108125467&UID=0&PW=b0f033281e Day 2] 
2. Enter your name and email address. 
3. Enter the meeting password: cgn 
4. Click "Join Now". 
5. A 'Join Teleconference' dialogue box will be presented, select your country code, then enter your local number and click OK from the Web Conference to join the Voice Conference portion of the meeting. 

Webex has availability of a bidirectional Global Voice Bridge. Participants have the following options to connect:
1. Call the local access number with a phone (note: select option '3' for the Webex conferencing
2. Have Webex call the participant during the startup of the Webex tool (descrbed above)
3. Use the Integrated Voice option in Webex (I just tested this with MSFT explorer software)

Usage of the voice bridge to speak and to reflect ideas is possible and the system is connected to an inroom speaker system. However due to a feedback loop we must control the 'mute/unmute' button on the Montreal end (we know it is suboptimal however it is the best we can provide with based upon the tools available). Please be aware of this complication when hearing echo on the line and to alert the person driving the phone connection. Also please mute your speaker sets when on the conference bridge through either of the above procedures.

Teleconference and Global access numbers can be found [http://trac.tools.ietf.org/area/int/trac/wiki/TeleconferenceForV4v6interim Here]

## Social Event 

The social event will take place at Gibby's restaurant in montreal [http://www.gibbys.com]

Gibbys is located in the Youville Stables which is part of a series of buildings once belonging to the Sisters of Charity, (or Grey Nuns), founded by Marguerite dâYouville. Part of the original structure was built in 1694, and served as The Grey Nunsâ General Hospital, which cared for the sick and destitute. However, most of the building dates from 1765 to 1850.
Gibbys Gates
	
Youville Stables received its name from the horsesâ stalls which were once located in the central courtyard. This part of the structure dates back to 1740 and was renovated in 1967, the first in a series of renovations in Old Montreal. The buildings now house the restaurant and private offices. 

The best way to get to the restaurant is by taking the metro to station Square Victoria and then walking from there for about 10 minutes
