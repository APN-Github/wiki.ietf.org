# Steps to Add a New Wiki Page 

You can create a new wiki page by typing the [CamelCase](/group/rtgwg/CamelCase) name of the page in the quick-search field at the top of the page, or by trying to view a wiki page of that name, ie by visiting for example http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MyNewWikiPage. Note that a page is "orphaned" by default until it is linked to from another page.

Prerequisite: make sure you actually have the rights to edit wiki pages. If you don't see the **Edit this page** button near the bottom of the page, read the information relative to the editing policy for your Trac installation, usually on the front page [WikiStart](/group/rtgwg/), or contact your local Trac administrator.

A new wiki page can also be created as follows:

1. Choose a name for your new page. See [WikiPageNames](/group/rtgwg/WikiPageNames) for naming conventions.
2. Edit an existing page or any other resource that support [WikiFormatting](/group/rtgwg/WikiFormatting) and add a [link](/group/rtgwg/TracLinks) to your new page. Save your changes.
3. Follow the link you created to take you to the new page. Trac will display a "describe PageName here" message.
4. Click the "Edit this page" button to edit and add content to your new page. Save your changes and your new page is published.
## Rename a page
While creating good [WikiPageNames](/group/rtgwg/WikiPageNames) is important for usability purposes, you can always rename the page later. You will need the WIKI_RENAME permission to rename pages.

When renaming a page, you'll be offered the possibility to create a redirection page, so that links pointing to the old location will not be pointing to a non-existent page.
