# Deleting a Wiki Page 
Wiki pages can be completely deleted using the *Delete page* or the *Delete this version* button at the bottom of the wiki page. These buttons are only visible for users that have the `WIKI_DELETE` permission.

**Note**: Deleting a wiki page is an irreversible operation.

Deleting specific versions or even complete pages can make sense to remove spam or other abusive submissions.

However, if you want to delete a page because you re-created a new page with the same content but a different name, it is recommended to keep the page and use it as a redirection page instead of completely deleting it. This will avoid frustrating the visitor with broken links, particularly when coming to the site from a search engine.

In this situation, chances are that you actually wanted to [rename](/group/rtgwg/WikiNewPage) the page instead of doing a copy and delete. The *Rename* operation offers you the possibility to create a redirection page. A redirection page is a short page that contains a link such as “See SomeOtherPage”.
