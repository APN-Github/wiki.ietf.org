# Accessibility Support in Trac 
Not every user has a graphic environment with a mouse or other pointing device. Some users rely on keyboard, alternative keyboard or voice input to navigate links and activate form controls. In a Trac session, users can use devices other than a pointing device by enabling keyboard shortcuts through the [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/rtgwg/prefs/keybindings) preferences panel.

Trac supports accessibility keys for the most common operations. The access keys differ by browser and the following work for several browsers:

- on Linux platforms, press any of the keys listed below in combination with the <`Alt>` key
- on a Mac, use the `<Ctrl>` + `<Opt>` key instead
- on Windows, you need to hit `<Shift>` + `<Alt>` + `<Key>`. This works for the most common browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer

Also see [access in different browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_key#Access_in_different_browsers) for more details.
