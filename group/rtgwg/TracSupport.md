# Trac Support 
Like in most [open source](https://opensource.org/) projects, Trac support is available primarily through the [mailing list](https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MailingList) and the [project wiki](https://trac.edgewall.org/). Both are maintained by the trac community. The [project wiki](https://trac.edgewall.org/) is the authoritative source for the [TracGuide](/group/rtgwg/TracGuide), consisting of the administrator and user guides for Trac.

There is an [IRC channel](https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/IrcChannel) where online users can help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.

You can search questions tagged with `trac` on [SO:tagged/trac Stack Overflow].

Before you start a new support query, make sure you have done the appropriate searching:

- in the project's [FAQ](https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracFaq)
- in past messages to the [Trac Users Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/g/trac-users?pli=1)
- in the Trac ticket system, using either a [full search](https://trac.edgewall.org/search?q=&ticket=on&wiki=on) or a [ticket query](https://trac.edgewall.org/query%3A%22%22).

Please **don't** create a ticket in trac.egdewall.org to ask a Trac support question. Only use it when you face a *real* and *new* bug in Trac, and do so only after having read the [NewTicketGuidelines](https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/NewTicketGuidelines). The more a bug report or enhancement request complies with those guidelines, the higher the chances are that it will be fixed or implemented promptly!
