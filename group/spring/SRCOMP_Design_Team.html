<p>Goal</p>
<p>The design team is established with a specific objective to look at the compression-related work. It is tasked to agree on a requirements proposal to the WG and a comparison document to be evaluated by the WG. &nbsp;To be clear, as is the normal case for the IETF, the design team outputs are input to the WG. &nbsp;Their output will not become a WG document until the WG agrees to adopt it. &nbsp;Also, these documents are for WG use. &nbsp;It will be for future analysis as to whether it is useful to the larger community to publish them as RFCs.</p>
<p>Roadmap &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stage 1: Prepare the requirement draft by end of September</p>
<p>- Phase 1: &nbsp;rough requirements list with several different categories, by 20th of Aug.</p>
<p>- Phase 2: &nbsp;one week for review by end of Aug.</p>
<p>- Phase 3: &nbsp;finish the draft by 20th of Sep.</p>
<p>- Phase 4: &nbsp;one week for review by end of Sep.</p>
<p>- Phase 5: &nbsp;Post it to WG and present it at IETF 109</p>
<p>&nbsp; Discussion order: follow the time of items.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Prepare the analysis draft by end of November (expected time, Let us talk about the schedule after the first draft finished.)</p>
<p>- Input: existing drafts by end of September</p>
