# Information about the NETMOD Interim Meeting, Oct 8 - 10, 2008

[Back to the top of the NETMOD wiki](/group/netmod/).

## Agenda

  1.  Introduction, WG Status and agenda bashing 

 2.    Work through known issues in the YANG and YANG types documents, with an emphasis on the former. The issues will be taken from the mailing list and from the wiki. See [the YANG issues](/group/netmod/Issues_yang) and [the types issues](/group/netmod/Issues_types). We will work on the types draft first in the assumption that there are fewer and simpler issues to deal with.

    	 Those issues lists will be (more) up-to-date by the end of this week. However, the assumption is that people are caught up on the mailing list, which is where the issues have been discussed. The authors and the chairs will work together to prioritize the lists so that focus is on the right issues. That prioritized list will be on the wiki by close of work on Friday. 

  3.  Discuss the architecture draft for possible acceptance as a starting point for the WG architecture draft. 

Reading you should do before arriving:

 1.   The two WG drafts: [YANG](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/netmod/draft-ietf-netmod-yang/) and [YANG types](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/netmod/draft-ietf-netmod-yang-types/). 

  2.  [The NETMOD mailing list](http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/netmod/current/maillist.html) 

  3.  [Phil Shafer's architecture draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-shafer-netmod-arch-00) 

Times:

 -   Wednesday: 8:30 - whenever

## Meeting Location

Ron Bonica (one of our ADs) is hosting the meeting at his site outside of Washington, D.C. The location is:

Juniper Networks
2251 Corporate Park Drive
Herndon, Virginia
U.S.A.

This is practically next door to Dulles International Airport, so book your tickets to Dulles.
Hotels

[Juniper's list of hotels near the site](http://www.juniper.net/company/contactus/locations/virginia-herndon.html).

Ron recommends the following:

​The Washington Dulles Airport Marriott
45020 Aviation Drive
Dulles, Virginia 20166
USA
Phone: +1-703-471-9500
Fax: +1-703-661-8714
The room rate appears to be 189 USD and up. Attendees can ask for the Juniper Network rate at any of the local hotels, but we do not yet know what that rate would be. Anyone who finds out what the rate really is, please contact David Partain.

12 minutes by car from Marriot to Juniper, over a toll road (google maps)

​The Westin Reston Heights‎
11750 Sunrise Valley Drive
Reston, Virginia 20191
USA
Phone: +1 703 391-9000
Fax: Fax: +1 703 391-9115
Email: info@…
The room rate appears to be 300 USD and up. Attendees can ask for the Juniper Network rate at any of the local hotels, but we do not yet know what that rate would be. Anyone who finds out what the rate really is, please contact David Partain.

7 minutes by car from Westin to Juniper, 3 miles walking (google maps)

​Hyatt Dulles
2300 Dulles Corner Blvd.,
Herndon, Virginia, USA 20171
Tel: +1 703 713 1234
Fax: +1 703 713 3410

​Hyatt Regency Reston
1800 Presidents Street,
Reston, Virginia, USA 20190
Tel: +1 703 709 1234
Fax: +1 703 925 8295

Juniper's office building is about half-way between the Hyatt Regency in Reston and the Hyatt Dulles. The Hyatt Dulles is usually visibly less expensive, but the Hyatt Regency Reston is directly at Reston Town Center with its wide range of restaurants within a 2-3 block radius of the hotel.

Ran Atkinson sent the following suggestions:

A nice, but lower-cost, hotel near the Juniper offices is:

​Homestead Studio Suites
12190 Sunset Hills Road
Reston, VA 20190
Phone: 703-707-9700
Fax: 703-707-9786

A nice feature of that hotel is that if the back of the hotel connects to a paved public trail and is easy walking distance to the restaurants at Reston Town Center. So one can trivially stay there and walk to/from a wide range of dinner spots.

At least a few people are going to be staying at this hotel.

## Other hotels in the area found on google maps by dbh

walking distances given by google maps, with warning that the roads may have no sidewalks. Google Earth shows what looks to be sidewalks.

google maps reports a number of restaurants within walking distance of these hotels - indian, mexican, sushi, pizza (Bertucci's), chinese.

Marriott
13010 Elm Tree Dr
Herndon, VA 20171
(571) 203-0892
0.2 miles from Juniper, 6 minute walk (google maps)

(Editor: This hotel is nowhere on the Marriott site and the phone number wasn't answered when called, so I'm skeptical that it even exists.)

Embassy Suites
13341 Woodland Park Road,
Herndon
(703) 464-0200‎
1.2 miles, 20 min walk (google maps)

Homewood Suites
13460 Sunrise Valley Drive,
Herndon
(703) 793-1700‎
1.4 miles, 28 min walk (google maps)

If you have other suggestions, please contact David Harrington or David Partain and we'll add them to this wiki.

## Getting Around

You may want access to a car to get around.

Cab fare to a hotel in Reston/Herndon/Oak? Hill runs about $15-$20 each way, depending upon the exact distance and on any delays (e.g. rush hour congestion). All legal cabs will have meters installed.

## Getting There by Train

Folks arriving by train can get to/from this area pretty easily. Take Amtrak to Union Station (Washington, DC). Then take the Metro (subway/underground) from Union Station to the "West Falls Church" Metro station.

Exit and turn LEFT right after exiting the fare gates. Down the stairs to the LEFT is a curved set of bus stands. There is an express bus to the "Herndon/Monroe?" "Park & Ride" and bus station. That bus stop is ~2 blocks from the Juniper offices and has a multi-story parking garage.

Taxi from downtown DC is expensive and Metro is usually much faster anyway. If one doesn't want the express bus on the last leg, exit West Falls Church Metro station fare gates and turn RIGHT, and look for the taxi stand outside. Taxi from here will be much lower cost (and safer) than taking a DC taxi from Union Station.
