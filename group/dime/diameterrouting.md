# Design Team on Diameter Routing

## Scope and History

The DIME chairs in discussion with Dan decided to create a design team with the intention to investigate extensions to the RFC 3588bis Diameter routing. More specifically, we had discussions about this subject triggered by the publication of [http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-tsou-dime-base-routing-ext-04.txt] that never got resolved and the impression of folks at the IETF72 meeting was that we have to investigate the usage scenarios and to develop a problem statement before we focus on the solution components.

The first product of the group will be a problem statement and usage scenarios description that will be presented to the DIME group. Other necessary activity will be decided based on the outcome of the above-mentioned deliverable.

The rules for design teams are described in [http://www.ietf.org/IESG/STATEMENTS/Design-Teams.txt]
