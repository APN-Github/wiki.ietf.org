# Documents Presented but not Adopted
* draft-am-bfd-performance - BFD Performance Measurement. (Not adopted)
  * Discussion around this document was helpful for the BFD stability draft work.
* draft-mirmin-bfd-extended - Extended BFD. (Not adopted)
  * Presented at IETF-104. Suggested that work be pursued as new BFD-like protocol in rtgwg.
* draft-tanmir-rtgwg-bfd-mc-lag-ip (Not adopted)
  * WG adoption poll ending 2017-04-30 did not show consensus to adopt.
* draft-tanmir-rtgwg-bfd-mc-lag-mpls (Not adopted)
  * WG adoption poll ending 2017-04-30 did not show consensus to adopt.
* draft-akiya-bfd-seamless-alert-discrim (abandoned)
  * 2015-03-25: Re-presented in BFD session. Author has decided to table the work and not seek adoption at this time.
* draft-snyder-bfd-proxy-connections-monitored-links (expired 2014-11)
  * 2014-07-21: Presented at IETF-90. No time to take questions at mic; requested comments to the list. Author also presented in MANET. Long term intention would be to adopt in BFD since the mechanism has potential for re-use outside of the immediately targeted scenario.
* draft-vgovindan-l2vpn-evpn-bfd (expired 2015-07)
  * 2014-07-21: Presented at IETF-90. Additionally, discussion notes that there may be some overlap with BFD Multipoint. Authors encouraged to work with multipoint draft editor to reconcile the use cases. Document should be updated afterward.
* draft-vgovindan-mpls-extended-bfd-disc-tlv (expired 2015-01)
  * 2014-07-21: Presented at IETF-90. Also presented in MPLS. Good line of questioning at mic. Authors are encouraged to discuss with authors of draft-mirsky-mpls-bfd-directed to create a single BFD TLV model.
* draft-zhang-bfd-new-use-cases (expired 2015-01)
  * 2014-07-21: Presented at IETF-90. Minimal discussion at mic; requested comments to the list. Author's intention is to adopt in BFD as a use case draft and drive solution drafts separately. However, a revision may be beneficial to clearly describe the use cases authors have in mind, in order to progress the discussion.
