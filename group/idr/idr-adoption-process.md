# IDR adoption process

IDR adopts two types of drafts.
## Type 1: drafts for approved work projects

Current projects:

 -   Flow Specification,
 -   BGP auto-configuration,
 -   Embedded NLRI:
 -   CAR/CT
 -   BGP-LS and SR
 -   urgent requests from other WGs. 

The drafts for WG projects are subjects of interims, Discussions on IDR mail list, and coaching by IDR chairs. These drafts get WG adoption calls ASAP.

## Type 2: Proposed drafts

What are they: great new ideas or revisions to drafts

The proposed drafts get added in order of request. However, the IDR chairs may ask the WG to take the questions out of order.

3/4/2022 IDR chairs have raised the question of putting draft-sas-idr-maxprefix-inbound to the head of the type 2 queue.
