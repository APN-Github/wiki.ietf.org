Please NOTE: A lot of regular correspondence with the Secretariat now happens through the Datatracker. For instance, document approval emails can be sent via the datatracker by editing the "IESG State" to "Approved, announcement to be sent."
- [Prototype tools by the IETF Tools Team pages](https://author-tools.ietf.org/).

- [On the origins of DISCUSS comments](/discusscomments) (This is an older page. Much of this is covered on the more recent ExpertTopics page)

#### Getting Started as an AD
- An IESG Charter, RFC 3710 (2004)

There is a lot of useful information on how to utilize the tools. As a new AD you will work with the Secretariat for access.

[Reference for All ADs](/newADinfo) on subjects such as basic AD responsibilities, using the datatracker, the document ballot process, and much more.

## Miscellaneous
The IESG has a [private Wiki Site](https://iesg.privatewikis.ietf.org/en/home).

The IETF Chair has a demanding [Chair Timeline](chairtimeline) to plan IETF meetings.

C code in I-Ds should do bound checking. The exception is when the code is a fragment and it's clear that it's a fragment. In that case a prominent note in the module needs to say "this is a code fragment, when this fragment is implemented as part of [insert_protocol_name] implement bound checking".

Wiki page for [Handling Changes When ID is in Queue](handlingchanges), [Legacy Errata Handling](legacyerrata), [Speaking for IETF](speakingforietf), [Dealing with Private Feedback in IETF Process](privatefeedback), [Ensuring Appropriate Discussion on IETFatIETF List](ensuringappropriatediscussion).

Dealing with some complicate IANA Registries: [Media Types](mediatypes) (a.k.a. MIME Types)

#### Some abandoned or obsolete stuff that's nonetheless useful to save

Wiki page for [Document Language Editing](documentlanguage) session at IETF 89 (2014) in  London.
[Draft Shepherd Writeup WG Alternate](draftshepherdwriteup) - A new proposal for a radical change to the shepherd writeup, as discussed at IETF 84 (2012). This is a version that strips out all the yes/no sorts of things and instead asks for a paragraph or two of information in each of five categories. **(This is now part of the normal shepherd writeup documentation.)** 
[Downref Registry](downrefregistryobsolete) - The former Down Ref Registry - which documents have been Last Called as Downrefs following RFC 3967 (BCP 97) procedure **(The Downref Registry has been moved into the datatracker as of 14 April 2017.)**
[Draft NoteWell Summary](draftnotewell) - A draft version of a very short Note Well summary. **(This is now dead.)**
[Draft Boilerplate Change](draftboilerplate) - A draft of a change to the boilerplate for cases where we are publishing something (such as documentation of a vendor-specific mechanism) where the community has consensus to publish, but consensus on the content doesn't make sense. **(The IAB has chosen not to approve this, but the text is still useful as an IESG note in such documents.)**
Off Duty - This has been moved to the IESG Private Wiki Site.
