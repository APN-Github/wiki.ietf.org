# Welcome to the IETF Community Wiki
This is a community wiki for IETF participants to use.  It replaces the previous structure of trac wikis where each working group/team had its own trac instance.  This is not intended to replace the main website, the Datatracker or any other micro-site.

The [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) applies to all content on this wiki, and it is referenced on every page.

- [Wikis for Groups](group) (including IETF working groups, IRTF research groups, and IAB programs)
- [Wikis for IETF Meetings](meeting) (starting with IETF 115)

# Contributing to this Wiki

Everybody with an [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/) account can create or edit pages on this Wiki. Private pages are allowed, but their creation is controlled by the wiki administrators. 

## Scope

This Wiki provides persistent working spaces for various IETF groups (such as Working Groups, Birds-of-a-Feather groups, Areas, Directorates, and Teams) and activities, such as IETF meetings.

It is not intended to be an alternative to the [www.ietf.org website](https://www.ietf.org)), nor to replace functionality of the [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/) (for example, as a repository for Internet-Drafts). It complements (but does not replace) the [IETF Notes service](https://notes.ietf.org), which is intended as a best-efforts service for ephemeral note and document creations.

## Content transition for group wikis
If you are responsible for content on an existing IETF wiki there are a number of resources available to help transition content from an existing Wiki.

> If you are an IETF or IRTF group chair and would like to initial help or additional information about transitioning your group's wiki to this platform, please contact: support@ietf.org.

**Quick tips**
1. Group pages are created on a FCFS basis using the path "/group/{{acronym}}"
> If a page doesn't already exist for your group, you can create it by simply navigating to:
> 	https://wiki.ietf.org/group/{{acronym}}
> 
> e.g., the page for the the 6man Working Group is at https://wiki.ietf.org/group/6man
{.is-info}

2. The [Markdown](https://docs.requarks.io/en/editors/markdown) editing mode of Wiki.js should be preferred when creating a new page in IETF Wiki.

3. Some online tools ease the initial creation of tables in Markdown ([Table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables); [for copy/paste from spreadsheets](https://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/)).

4. Subpages for any particular group can be created using the same method as described above in 1.
> When linking to subpage from a group page, you can use the syntax: ``[link text](page_name)``
> e.g. the markdown for linking to the main IDR page at https://wiki.ietf.org/e/en/group/idr to the subpage at https://wiki.ietf.org/group/idr/idr-draft-status looks like: ``[idr-draft-status](idr-draft-status)``
