# Welcome to the IETF Community Wiki
This is a community wiki for IETF participants to use.  It replaces the previous structure of trac wikis where each working group/team had its own trac instance.  

The [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) applies to all content on this wiki, and it is referenced on every page.

# Scope

This wiki provides persistent working spaces for various IETF groups (such as Working Groups, Birds-of-a-Feather groups, Areas, Directorates, and Teams) and activities, such as IETF meetings.

This wiki should not be used for content that should be on any of the other dedicated IETF sites.  For example the following are out of scope:
* Explanatory/general text about the IETF.
* Repository/listing/metadata for Internet-Drafts and/or RFCs
* Information for authors of I-Ds.
* Information about the AUTH48 process.

This wiki complements (but does not replace) the [IETF Notes service](https://notes.ietf.org), which is intended as a best-efforts service for ephemeral note and document creations.

# Contributing to this wiki
This wiki is for the IETF Community and any IETF participant is welcome to edit it. See the [Contributing to this wiki](/contributing) page for a quick start guide and more details.

# Other IETF websites
The other IETF websites where relevant information can be found are:
* www.ietf.org: the public-facing front door for the IETF.

* authors.ietf.org: the Internet-Draft/RFC author resources site
