# Welcome to the IETF Community Wiki
This is a community wiki for IETF participants to use.  It replaces the previous structure of trac wikis where each working group/team had its own trac instance.  This is not intended to replace the main website, the Datatracker or any other micro-site.

The [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) applies to all content on this wiki, and it is referenced on every page.

- [Wikis for Groups](group) (including IETF working groups, IRTF research groups, and IAB programs)
- [Wikis for IETF Meetings](meeting) (starting with IETF 115)

## Scope

This wiki provides persistent working spaces for various IETF groups (such as Working Groups, Birds-of-a-Feather groups, Areas, Directorates, and Teams) and activities, such as IETF meetings.

This wiki should not be used for content that should be on any of the other dedicated IETF sites, including:
* The [www.ietf.org website](https://www.ietf.org)), For example, by adding explanatory/general text about the IETF.
* The [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/). For example, by creating a repository for Internet-Drafts. 
* The [I-D Authors Resource site](https://authors.ietf.org/).  For example, by adding information for authors of I-Ds.
* The [RFC Editor site](https://www.rfc-editor.org/).  For example, by adding informationa about the AUTH48 process.
If you want to make any changes to those sites, then please do so following the process described on each site.

This wiki complements (but does not replace) the [IETF Notes service](https://notes.ietf.org), which is intended as a best-efforts service for ephemeral note and document creations.

## Contributing to this wiki
This wiki is for the IETF Communityâ€”any IETF participant is welcome to edit it.

See the [Contributing to this wiki](/contributing) page for a quick start guide and more details.
