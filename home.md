# Welcome to the IETF Community Wiki
This is a community wiki for IETF participants to use.  It replaces the previous structure of trac wikis where each working group/team had its own trac instance.  This is not intended to replace the main website, the Datatracker or any other micro-site.

The [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) applies to all content on this wiki, and it is referenced on every page.

# Contributing to this Wiki

Everybody with an [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/) account can create or edit pages on this Wiki. Private pages are allowed, but their creation is controlled by the wiki administrators. 

## Scope

This Wiki provides persistent working spaces for various IETF groups (such as Working Groups, Birds-of-a-Feather groups, Areas, Directorates, and Teams) and activities, such as IETF meetings.

It is not intended to be an alternative to the [www.ietf.org website](https://www.ietf.org)), nor to replace functionality of the [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/) (for example, as a repository for Internet-Drafts). It complements (but does not replace) the [IETF Notes service](https://notes.ietf.org), which is intended as a best-efforts service for ephemeral note and document creations.

## Editing help

The [Markdown](https://docs.requarks.io/en/editors/markdown) editing mode of Wiki.js should be prefered in IETF Wiki.

There are some online tools avaible to ease the initial creation of tables in Markdown ([Table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables); [for copy/paste from spreadsheets](https://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/)).

There's also a [sandbox](/sandbox) for trying out Wiki editing.

If you are an IETF or IRTF group chair and would like additional information about transitioning your group's wiki to this platform, please contact: support@ietf.org.
