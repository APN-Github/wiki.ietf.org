# Welcome to the IETF Community Wiki
This is a community wiki for IETF participants to use.  It replaces the previous structure of trac wikis where each working group/team had its own trac instance.  This is not intended to replace the main website, the Datatracker or any other micro-site.

The [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) applies to all content on this wiki, and it is referenced on every page.

- [Wikis for Groups](group) (including IETF working groups, IRTF research groups, and IAB programs)
- [Wikis for IETF Meetings](meeting) (starting with IETF 115)

## Scope

This wiki provides persistent working spaces for various IETF groups (such as Working Groups, Birds-of-a-Feather groups, Areas, Directorates, and Teams) and activities, such as IETF meetings.

It is not intended to be an alternative to the [www.ietf.org website](https://www.ietf.org)), nor to replace functionality of the [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/) (for example, as a repository for Internet-Drafts). It complements (but does not replace) the [IETF Notes service](https://notes.ietf.org), which is intended as a best-efforts service for ephemeral note and document creations.

See the [Contributing to this wiki](/contributing) page for quick start guide and more details.
