Everybody with an [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/) account can create or edit pages on this Wiki. Private pages are allowed, but their creation is controlled by the wiki administrators. To log in, click on the icon in the upper right corner on each page.

## General guidance and tools

The [Markdown](https://docs.requarks.io/en/editors/markdown) editing mode of Wiki.js should be preferred when creating a new page in IETF Wiki.

Some online tools ease the initial creation of tables in Markdown ([Table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables); [for copy/paste from spreadsheets](https://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/)).

## Content transition for group wikis
If you are responsible for content on an existing IETF wiki there are a number of resources available to help transition content from an existing Wiki.

> If you are an IETF or IRTF group chair and would like to initial help or additional information about transitioning your group's wiki to this platform, please contact: support@ietf.org.

**Quick start**
1. Group pages are created on a FCFS basis using the path "/group/{{acronym}}"
> If a page doesn't already exist for your group, you can create it by simply navigating to:
> 	``https://wiki.ietf.org/group/{{acronym}}``
> 
> e.g., the main wiki page for the the [6man Working Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/6man/about/) is at https://wiki.ietf.org/group/6man
{.is-info}

2. Subpages for any particular group can be created using the same method as described above.
> When linking to subpage from a group page, you can use the syntax: ``[link text](page_name)``
> e.g. the markdown for linking to the main IDR page at https://wiki.ietf.org/e/en/group/idr to the subpage at https://wiki.ietf.org/group/idr/idr-draft-status looks like: ``[idr-draft-status](idr-draft-status)``
{.is-info}

5. When the new wiki is ready, you can send email to support@ietf.org for the group wiki to be added to the [index of group wikis](/group) and confirm transition from the old wiki is in place.

Want to try out the new wiki platform with out creating a  page of your own? There's also a [sandbox](/sandbox) for trying out Wiki editing.

### Content-o-thons 
If you have responsibility for any active IETF-related wiki (e.g. working group or directorate wiki), and are looking to get help or a head start on moving content, you are encouraged to participate in an upcoming content-o-thon. These events are open to anyone who wants a focused time to work on and get help with setting up content at wiki.ietf.org, covering topics such as:
+ New wiki set up
+ Documentation and tools for wiki maintainers
+ Platform-wide features and content
